Chapters  0:00 Introduction 0:54 Types of Parasomnia 1:35 Causes of Parasomnia 2:11 Symptoms 2:44 Diagnosis for Parasomnia 3:12 Treatment of Parasomnia   Parasomnias are a category of sleep disorders that involve abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, and dreams that occur while falling asleep, sleeping, between sleep stages, or during arousal from sleep. Parasomnias are dissociated sleep states which are partial arousals during the transitions between wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep, and their combinations. The newest version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, 3rd. Ed.) uses State Dissociation as the paradigm for parasomnias.[1][2] Unlike before, where wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were considered exclusive states, research has shown that combinations of these states are possible and thus, may result in unusual unstable states that could eventually manifest as parasomnias or as altered levels of awareness.[1][3][4][5][6][7]  Although the previous definition is technically correct, it contains flaws. The consideration of the State Dissociation paradigm facilitates the understanding of the sleep disorder and provides a classification of 10 core categories.[1][2] NREM parasomnias are arousal disorders that occur during stage 3 (or 4 by the R&K standardization) of NREM sleep\u2014also known as slow wave sleep (SWS). They are caused by a physiological activation in which the patient's brain exits from SWS and is caught in between a sleeping and waking state. In particular, these disorders involve activation of the autonomic nervous system, motor system, or cognitive processes during sleep or sleep-wake transitions.[8]  Some NREM parasomnias (sleep-walking, night-terrors, and confusional arousal) are common during childhood but decrease in frequency with increasing age. They can be triggered in certain individuals, by alcohol, sleep deprivation, physical activity, emotional stress, depression, medications, or a fevered illness. These disorders of arousal can range from confusional arousals, somnambulism, to night terrors. Other specific disorders include sleepeating, sleep sex, teeth grinding, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome, and somniloquy.", "tags": ["parasomnia", "parasomnia caught on camera", "parasomnia treatment", "parasomnia sleep disorder", "parasomnia movie", "parasomnia smell", "parasomnia in hindi"], "comments": 6, "likes": "79", "channel_name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "channel_subscribers": "276000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 241.0, "keyword": "Dyssomnias", "rank": 4, "consine similarity": 0.0}

Polycythemia may be a \u201crelative polycythemia\u201d resulting from dehydration or volume contraction or an \u201cabsolute polycythemia\u201d where there is an increase in the number of red cells. Absolute polycythemia may be primary or secondary.  Primary Polycythemia (or polycythemia vera) is caused by a mutation in the kinase that stimulates red blood cell production i.e. the JAK2V617F mutation. Patients can be tested for this mutation, which is positive in 80-95% of patients with polycythemia vera. Secondary polycythemia is due to conditions such as sleep apnea or hypoxia that stimulate erythropoietin (EPO) to produce red cells. Inappropropriate erythropoietin production is seen in patients with rare tumours. Medications such as synthetic EPO and testosterone can also stimulate red cell production.  Patients with polycythemia vera can be asymptomatic. However they often suffer   Hyperviscosity symptoms (headaches, vertigo, burning at the extremities)or Thrombotic symptoms such a deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, hepatic vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke or digital infarcts/critical limb ischemia.  Patients may also have symptoms of gout, heartburn or pruritus due to excessive histamine release from mast cells. Patients can also have bleeding symptoms.  Once a diagnosis of polycythemia is made, a referral to a hematologist for further management is appropriate. Medications that may be contributing to polycythemia must be stopped. Smoking cessation can often normalize hemoglobin levels, and this must be strongly encouraged in a patients with all forms of polycythemia.   In patients with polycythemia vera, therapeutic phlebotomy is indicated to reduce the hematocrit to 45%: ASA 81 mg a day is started and a cytoreductive agent such as hydroxyurea may be initiated by a hematologist.   The primary care provider has a role in managing cardiac risk factors in patients with polycythemia (hypertension, hyperlipidemia and glycemic control) as the most common cause of death in patients with polycythemia is due to thrombotic complications.", "tags": ["medskl.com", "FOAMEd", "clinical", "animation", "medical", "school", "CME"], "comments": 0, "likes": "566", "channel_name": "Medskl.com", "chanenelID": "UC54htze_JB0zz9H6oAbMOJQ", "channel_subscribers": "80100", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 211.0, "keyword": "Elevated hematocrit", "rank": 3, "consine similarity": 0.10101525445522107}

The most common complaints include nasal congestion, chronic pain or pressure over the face or eyes, no fever, and no purulent drainage. The headaches typically are between the eyes, forehead, cheeks, or all these regions. Other symptoms that may or may not be present, include light and/or noise sensitivity, pain worsening with movement, nausea and/or vomiting, runny nose, and watery eyes. These headaches last ~4-72 hours, with or without antibiotics, and occurs regularly, up to several times a month.  However, the reality is that ~80% of such patients are actually suffering from migraines or some other type of neurologic condition.

Doghramji, MD, FAAFP  The educational design of this activity addresses the needs of primary care providers (PCPs), sleep specialists, and other clinicians involved in the identification and ongoing treatment of patients with non\u201324-hour sleep-wake disorder (non-24 disorder). Non-24 disorder is an intrinsic circadian rhythm disorder characterized by cyclic desynchronization between the patient\u2019s endogenous physiologic rhythms and the earth\u2019s 24-hour light/dark cycle. Although most affected individuals are totally blind and completely lack the daily entrainment signal provided by light, recent research has suggested that the disorder is more common than previously appreciated in partially blind patients, and\u2014albeit still rare\u2014in sighted teenagers and young adults. Delays or even complete failures in the diagnosis of non-24 disorder are all too common, in part because patients do not proactively discuss sleep problems with their clinicians. Time-constrained providers also may not specifically probe for the presence of the cardinal symptoms of excessive sleepiness and insomnia, even in high-risk cohorts. Clinicians are further challenged to individualize evidence-based treatment regimens, especially because the recently updated national practice parameters on managing intrinsic circadian rhythm disorders do not fully integrate the only agent that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of non-24 disorder. This online Point-of-Care 101 (POC101) program has been built around a 3D animation and lively discussions between 2 sleep medicine experts on the pathophysiologic basis of non-24 disorder, actionable diagnostic recommendations, nonpharmacologic treatment approaches, and the latest evidence for pharmacologic modalities.

Psychiatry \u2013 Sleep Disorders Whiteboard Animation Transcript with Elliott Lee, MD https://medskl.com/Course/Detail/psychiatry  Sleep problems can be divided into complaints that people have:  1. One of the most common complaints is excessive daytime sleepiness. There are generally 5 major causes for excessive daytime sleepiness\u2026  \u2026the most common of which is an insufficient quantity of sleep. Many medical students suffer from this!  Next is a poor quality of sleep. Environmental disturbances (such as light, partner, pet), or other intrinsic sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder could be involved.   Thirdly, and less common, is a pathologic disorder of sleepiness during the day, including narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.   Fourthly, a medical or psychiatric disorder, such as a thyroid condition, cancer, medication side effect, or mood disorder can present with sleepiness.  Finally, a circadian rhythm disorder such as shift work, or jet lag could also be a culprit.  2. On the other hand, sometimes patients complain of difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, or \u201cinsomnia\u201d. This symptom can be a primary disorder on its own, but is usually the result of, or exacerbated by one or a combination of four factors:   An acute stressor.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. A skeletal muscle contracts only when stimulated by nerve impulses from a motor neuron.  The axon of a motor neuron usually gives out many branches, supplying multiple muscle fibers. These fibers  constitute a motor unit. Small motor units are found in muscles that require finer control, for example, muscles that are responsible for subtle movements of the eyes. Large motor units are found in larger muscles that require strength, such as muscles of the arms and legs. The strength of a muscle contraction is determined by the number of motor units that are activated at one time. Even at rest, most muscles are in a partial contraction state, called muscle tonus, which is maintained by alternating activation of a small number of motor units.  The connection between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber is called a neuromuscular junction, which is basically a chemical synapse between the nerve terminal and a specialized area of muscle cell membrane called the motor end-plate. When an action potential reaches the nerve terminal, it causes the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic space. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on the end-plate. Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels. Upon binding to acetylcholine, they open to allow sodium to enter the cells, depolarizing the cell membrane, producing the so-called end-plate potential.  An action potential is generated in the muscle cell only when the end-plate potential reaches the threshold required to activate voltage-gated sodium channels located outside the end-plate, in the neighboring membrane. When activated, these channels allow faster influx of sodium, further depolarizing and eventually reversing the polarity of the cell membrane. At this point, voltage-gated potassium channels open for potassium to move out, quickly returning membrane voltage to its original resting value.  Once generated, the action potential spreads like a wave thanks to similar voltage-gated ion channels located throughout the muscle fiber.  The action potential also runs deep into the fiber via T-tubules, to reach the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Here, it activates voltage-gated calcium channels, releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol of muscle cells. Calcium then sets off muscle contraction by the \u201csliding filament mechanism\u201d. This mechanism is described in another video. Another important component of the neuromuscular junction is the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme removes all acetylcholine molecules that do not immediately bind with a receptor and those that are done activating a receptor. The enzyme action essentially terminates synaptic activation, giving the muscle time to relax, and thus preventing continuous contraction that would result in muscle spasms. Substances that cause muscle weakness or paralysis do so by interfering with the function of neuromuscular junction:  - Botulinum toxin prevents acetylcholine release from the presynaptic side of the junction.   - Some other toxins attach to nicotinic receptor, blocking acetylcholine from binding, but do not open the ion channel.  - Certain drugs lodge into the channel of nicotinic receptor, blocking the passage of sodium.  All these substances prevent activation of muscle cells and cause flaccid paralysis. On the other hand, some pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase, preventing degradation of acetylcholine, causing continuous activation of muscles. That\u2019s how they induce muscle spasms and cause spastic paralysis.", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "axon", "motor unit", "muscle contraction", "muscle tonus", "neuromuscular junction", "chemical synapse", "motor endplate", "action potential in skeletal muscle", "Ach", "AChE", "nicotinic receptors", "ligand-gated ion channels", "EPP", "end-plate potential", "voltage-gated sodium channel", "T-tubules", "SR", "muscle spasms", "paralysis", "causes", "mechanism of action toxins", "pesticides", "medical", "neurobiology", "neurology", "neuron electrophysiology", "neuroscience", "science", "curare", "snake venom", "local anesthetics"], "comments": 68, "likes": "6915", "channel_name": "Alila Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A", "channel_subscribers": "997000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 289.0, "keyword": "NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASES", "rank": 19, "consine similarity": 0.0}

Chapters   0:00 Introduction  1:58 Causes of Obesity  3:32 Symptoms of Obesity  3:58 Diagnosis of Obesity  4:48 Treatment of Obesity     Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to an extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over 30 kg/m2; the range 25\u201330 kg/m2 is defined as overweight.Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis, and depression.  Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not medically supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.", "tags": ["Obesity epidemic in america", "Obesity documentary bbc", "Obesity documentary uk", "Obesity documentary", "Obesity epidemic documentary", "Obesity treatment in homeopathy", "Obesity in pakistan", "Obesity in hindi", "Obesity in urdu", "Obesity lecture in urdu", "Obesity meaning in urdu", "Obesity homeopathic medicine", "Obesity pronunciation", "Obesity treatment", "Obesity"], "comments": 184, "likes": "3156", "channel_name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "channel_subscribers": "276000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 338.0, "keyword": "OBESITY", "rank": 24, "consine similarity": 0.0}

Chapters   0:00 Introduction  1:15 Causes of Sleep Apnea  2:00 Symptoms of Sleep Apnea  2:23 Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea  3:39 Treatment of Sleep Apnea     Sleep apnea, also spelled sleep apnoea, is a sleep disorder in which pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep occur more often than normal.[1] Each pause can last for a few seconds to a few minutes and they happen many times a night.[1] In the most common form, this follows loud snoring.[2] There may be a choking or snorting sound as breathing resumes.[1] Because the disorder disrupts normal sleep, those affected may experience sleepiness or feel tired during the day.[1] In children, it may cause hyperactivity or problems in school.[2]  Sleep apnea may be either obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in which breathing is interrupted by a blockage of air flow, central sleep apnea (CSA), in which regular unconscious breath simply stops, or a combination of the two.[1] OSA is the most common form.[1] OSA has four key contributors; these include \u201canatomical compromises\" like a narrow, crowded, or collapsible upper airway. Or \u201cnon-anatomical\u201d ones like an ineffective pharyngeal dilator muscle function during sleep, airway narrowing during sleep, or unstable control of breathing (high loop gain).[11] Other risk factors include being overweight, a family history of the condition, allergies, and enlarged tonsils.[7] Some people with sleep apnea are unaware they have the condition.[1] In many cases it is first observed by a family member.[1] Sleep apnea is often diagnosed with an overnight sleep study.[8] For a diagnosis of sleep apnea, more than five episodes per hour must occur.[12]", "tags": ["sleep apnea", "sleep apnea machine", "sleep apnea beach fossils", "sleep apnea treatment", "sleep apnea exercises", "sleep apnea snoring", "sleep apnea chevelle", "sleep apnea symptoms", "sleep apnea test", "sleep apnea mouthpiece", "sleep apnea sounds", "sleep apnea snoring sound", "sleep apnea va claim", "sleep apnea surgery vs cpap"], "comments": 71, "likes": "1258", "channel_name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "channel_subscribers": "276000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 288.0, "keyword": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome", "rank": 22, "consine similarity": 0.08304547985373997}

Normally when you breathe in, air flows in through your mouth and nose and down your throat, also called the pharynx. Air then slows down your windpipe, or trachea, spreading through a tree-like structure of smaller tubes into your lungs.   Each time you breathe in, negative suction pressure pulls the soft tissues in your mouth and pharynx inward. The muscles in your pharynx respond by pulling the soft tissues outward again, which keeps your airway open.   When you sleep, it's normal for the muscles in your mouth, tongue, and pharynx to relax slightly, but not enough to block your airway. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles of your mouth and pharynx may relax too much. Your tongue drops onto the soft tissue in the roof of your mouth, pressing it against the back of your throat. This completely blocks the flow of air into your lungs. The lack of oxygen in your lungs wakes you up. You may gasp for air to reestablish air flow before falling asleep again.   The cycle of apnea and waking up may happen many times at night, preventing restful sleep. Factors that may contribute to obstructive sleep apnea include obesity, because more fat may be present in the walls of the pharynx, a small or receding jaw with a narrowed airway, loss of muscle tone in your pharynx due to aging, and swollen tonsils.   Common symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea are snoring, morning headaches, chronic daytime sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, and impaired concentration. Left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea may lead to complications, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, irregular heart beats, called arrhythmias, stroke, and diabetes.   Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to treat obstructive sleep apnea, including losing weight, sleeping on your side, not smoking, and avoiding substances that can make you sleepy, such as alcohol and sedatives.   For mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea, an oral appliance may keep your airway open. This device works by pulling your jaw forward and moving both your tongue and the roof of your mouth away from the back of your throat.   The most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is a continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP machine. This machine pumps air through a tube into a mask that fits over your nose or both your nose and mouth. The mild air pressure of the CPAP machine helps keep your airway open, enabling you to get a deep, restful sleep.  #SleepApnea #Snoring #CPAP", "tags": ["3D", "medical", "animation", "patient education", "video", "health literacy", "obstructive sleep apnea", "breathing", "sleep", "pharynx", "pharyngeal", "throat", "lungs", "uvula", "palate", "oral", "dental appliance", "CPAP", "air", "oxygen", "device", "health", "nucleus medical media", "Sleep Apnea (Disease Or Medical Condition)", "respiratory", "sleeping", "Bed"], "comments": 1469, "likes": "32296", "channel_name": "Nucleus Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UC85VW73bQLEjs_taFKP7TwQ", "channel_subscribers": "6130000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 259.0, "keyword": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome", "rank": 6, "consine similarity": 0.0}

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a PROGRESSIVE inflammatory lung disease characterized by INCREASING breathing difficulty. Other symptoms include cough, most commonly with mucus, chest tightness and wheezing. COPD develops as a result of LONG-TERM exposure to irritants such as smoke, chemical fumes or dusts, and may go UNNOTICED for years. Most people show symptoms after the age of 40 when the disease is already in its advanced stage. The lungs consist of millions of air tubes or airways, called bronchi and bronchioles, which bring air in and out of the body. These airways end with tiny air sacs - the alveoli - where the gas exchange process takes place. REPEATED inhalation of irritants results in a CHRONIC inflammatory response which brings in a large amount of defensive cells along with inflammatory chemicals from the immune system. Inflammation of the airways causes them to thicken and produce mucus, NARROWING the air passage \u2013 this is known as CHRONIC BRONCHITIS. Inflammatory chemicals also dissolve alveolar walls, resulting in DESTRUCTION of the air sacs \u2013 this is EMPHYSEMA. COPD is, basically, a COMBINATION of these two conditions. Tobacco smoking is accountable for about 90% of COPD cases. These include current, former smokers and people frequently exposed to second-hand smoke.    Extended contact with harmful chemicals such as fumes from burning fuel or dusts, at home or workplace, may also cause COPD. Genetics has been implicated in a small number of cases. Notably, a condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AAT deficiency, has been shown to increase risks for COPD and other lung diseases. AAT protein protects the lungs from damaging effects of enzymes released during inflammation. Low levels of AAT make lung tissues more vulnerable to destruction when inflamed. While people with AAT deficiency may develop COPD even WITHOUT smoking or exposure to harmful irritants, AAT deficient smokers are at MUCH greater risks. COPD is diagnosed based on symptoms, history of exposure to irritants and lung function tests. The major test for COPD is SPIROMETRY, in which the patient is asked to blow into a tube connected to a machine \u2013 a spirometer. Spirometry evaluates pulmonary functions by measuring the volume and the speed of air flow during inhalation and exhalation.  There is no cure for COPD but treatments can relieve symptoms, prevent complications and slow down progression of the disease. The first and most essential step to treatment is to stop smoking and/or improve air quality at home and workplace. These are also the most effective measures in preventing the disease.  Other treatments include: -Medication: bronchodilators are used to widen the airways; steroids to relieve inflammation. -Vaccination against flu and pneumococcal pneumonia: this is to prevent serious complications COPD patients may have with these respiratory infections. -Supplemental oxygen: this can improve quality of life provided that the patient no longer smokes. -Breathing exercises and other therapies as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program. -Finally, surgery may be performed for severe cases when other methods fail. Surgical procedures include bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, where damaged parts of the lung are removed; and lung transplant, where the entire diseased lung is replaced with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "AAT deficiency", "alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency", "alveoli", "anatomy", "animated", "animation", "breathing difficulty", "bronchi", "bronchioles", "causes", "chronic bronchitis", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "conditions", "COPD", "diagnosis", "diseases", "emphysema", "gene", "genetics", "inflammation", "lung", "lung function test", "mechanism", "medical", "medicine", "pathology", "problems", "public health", "pulmonary", "pulmonology", "respiration", "respiratory", "risk factors", "smoke", "smoker", "smoking", "spirometry", "symptoms", "treatments"], "comments": 48, "likes": "2710", "channel_name": "Alila Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A", "channel_subscribers": "997000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 258.0, "keyword": "Obstructive Syndrome", "rank": 6, "consine similarity": 0.0}

The condition is defined and some of its causes are listed. This lesson goes into detail about CPR in these situations, and the ACLS manual Figure 21 provides further information about the ACLS Survey.  \"Respiratory arrest is an emergent condition in which the individual is either not breathing or is breathing ineffectively. Individuals in respiratory arrest require immediate attention.   There are many causes of respiratory arrest, including but not limited to cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock. Resuscitate individuals in apparent respiratory arrest using either the BLS or the ACLS Survey.  The BLS Survey advises to check for responsiveness, call EMS and get AED, check for responsiveness again, and defibrillate. Figure 20 in your corresponding ACLS manual details the BLS survey.   The ACLS Survey follows the ABCD pattern, in which you check for Airway, Breathing, Circulation, and  Differential Diagnosis. Refer to Figure 21 in your corresponding ACLS manual to further learn about the ACLS Survey.  When caring for individuals in respiratory arrest, keep in mind the two types of ventilation: advanced and basic. Advanced ventilation includes an esophageal-tracheal tube, endotracheal tube, laryngeal tube, and laryngeal mask airway. Basic ventilation includes mouth-to-mouth or nose, bag-mask ventilation, oropharyngeal airway, and nasopharyngeal airway.   Although OPAs and NPAs are considered to be basic airways, they require proper placement by an experienced provider. Advanced airway insertion requires specialized training beyond the scope of ACLS certification. While the placement of advanced airways requires specialized training, all ACLS providers should know the proper use of advanced airways once they are placed. Regardless of airway type, proper airway management is an important part of ACLS.   CPR is performed with the individual lying on their back; gravity causes the jaw, the tongue, and the tissues of the throat to fall back and obstruct the airway. The airway rarely remains open in an unconscious individual without any external support. Therefore, you have to open the airway by lifting the chin upward while tilting the forehead back. This is known as the head-tilt-chin-lift maneuver. The goal is to create a straighter path from the nose to the trachea.  In individuals with a suspected neck injury, protect the cervical spine by performing the jaw-thrust maneuver to open the airway. While standard practice in a suspected neck injury is to place a cervical collar, this should not be done in BLS or ACLS. Cervical collars can compress the airway and interfere with resuscitation efforts. As a provider, you must ensure an open airway regardless of the basic airway used. It is your responsibility to stabilize the head or ask for assistance while maintaining control of the airway.  During respiratory arrest care, be sure not to over ventilate, that is given too many breaths per minute or too large volume per breath. Both can increase intrathoracic pressure, decrease venous return to the heart, diminished cardiac output, as well as predispose individuals to vomit and aspiration of gastrointestinal contents.\"   Need certified or rectified in ACLS, visit https://disquefoundation.org/acls-course-certification-renewal/ ************************************** Follow us on social media!

Your brain senses this inability to breathe and briefly awakens you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway.    This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it.  You may make a snorting, gasping or choking sound.    This may happen a few times a night, or in more severe cases, several hundred times a night.  People with OSA may not be aware that their sleep was ever interrupted.  If you think you may have this form of sleep apnea, contact a physician.

Chapters  0:00 Introduction 1:24 Causes of Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder 2:26 Symptoms of Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder 3:54 treatment for Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder      Breathing-related sleep disorder refers to a spectrum of breathing anomalies ranging from chronic or habitual snoring to upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) to frank obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or, in some cases, obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS).   Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most common and serious sleep-related breathing disorders. In OSA, the airway repeatedly collapses during sleep, causing lapses in breathing that both fragment sleep and affect the body\u2019s oxygen levels. Upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) is a milder form of OSA in which sleep is disrupted but oxygen levels are not affected to the same degree.  OSA may affect as many as 30% of adults and is more common in men than women2. The condition is likely underdiagnosed, and many experts anticipate that its prevalence will increase in the future along with growing rates of obesity, which is one of the major risk factors for OSA.  Snoring, gasping or choking during sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness are central symptoms of OSA. When left untreated, the condition can cause significant health problems including cardiovascular issues like high blood pressure and stroke. A range of treatment options are effective in addressing obstructive sleep apnea and reducing its symptoms.  In central sleep apnea (CSA), the basic neurological controls for breathing rate malfunction and fail to give the signal to inhale, causing the individual to miss one or more cycles of breathing. If the pause in breathing is long enough, the percentage of oxygen in the circulation will drop to a lower than normal level (hypoxaemia) and the concentration of carbon dioxide will build to a higher than normal level (hypercapnia). In turn, these conditions of hypoxia and hypercapnia will trigger additional effects on the body. Brain cells need constant oxygen to live, and if the level of blood oxygen goes low enough for long enough, brain damage and even death will occur. A systemic disorder, sleep apnea is associated with a wide array of effects, including increased risk of car accidents, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, insulin resistance, higher incidence of cancer, and neurodegeneration. The exact effects of the condition will depend on how severe the apnea is and on the individual characteristics of the person having the apnea.  Treatment may include lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, breathing devices, and surgery. Effective lifestyle changes may include avoiding alcohol, losing weight, stopping smoking, and sleeping on one's side. Breathing devices include the use of a CPAP machine. With proper use, CPAP improves outcomes. Evidence suggests that CPAP may improve sensitivity to insulin, blood pressure, and sleepiness. Long term compliance, however, is an issue with more than half of people not appropriately using the device. In 2017, only 15% of potential patients in developed countries used CPAP machines, while in developing countries well under 1% of potential patients used CPAP. Without treatment, sleep apnea may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, obesity, and motor vehicle collisions.  Alzheimer's disease and severe obstructive sleep apnea are connected because there is an increase in the protein beta-amyloid as well as white-matter damage. These are the main indicators of Alzheimer's, which in this case comes from the lack of proper rest or poorer sleep efficiency resulting in neurodegeneration. Having sleep apnea in mid-life brings a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer's in older age, and if one has Alzheimer's then one is also more likely to have sleep apnea. This is demonstrated by cases of sleep apnea even being misdiagnosed as dementia. With the use of treatment through CPAP, there is a reversible risk factor in terms of the amyloid proteins. This usually restores brain structure and diminishes cognitive impairment.  OSA is a common sleep disorder. A large analysis in 2019 of the estimated prevalence of OSA found that OSA affects 936 million\u20141 billion people between the ages of 30-69 globally, or roughly every 1 in 10 people, and up to 30% of the elderly. Sleep apnea is somewhat more common in men than women, roughly a 2:1 ratio of men to women, and in general more people are likely to have it with older age and obesity.", "tags": ["sleep disorders", "sleep disorder", "sleep apnea", "sleep related breathing disorders", "breathing related sleep disorder", "sleep disordered breathing", "breathing disorder", "sleep", "what is sleep disorders", "sleep disorder breathing", "what is sleep disorder", "breathing-related sleep disorders", "sleep disorder (symptom)", "breathing disorders", "types of sleep disordered breathing", "breathing", "sleep disorders in hindi", "what are sleep disorders"], "comments": 2, "likes": "54", "channel_name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "channel_subscribers": "276000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 281.0, "keyword": "Sleep Wake Disorders", "rank": 25, "consine similarity": 0.03322277470925477}

This video is to provide information regarding a condition known as Tachycardia, a fast heartbeat when resting.   We explain the condition and the symptoms associated with Tachycardia since so many people are un-diagnosed. We share the symptoms one may or may not experience with the condition as well as how doctors diagnose the condition. We discuss some risk factors that could lead to an early diagnosis and how the condition is sometimes treated.   We also talk about whether this is something you can prevent from developing. It is extremely important to discuss with your doctor if you ever experience a high heart rate while resting. It is very possible that it is a sign of another problem that is beginning to manifest with symptoms.

Voice by : Marty Henne Support us on Patreon and get early access to videos and free image downloads: patreon.com/AlilaMedicalMedia Supraventricular tachycardia, SVT, refers to rapid heart rhythms that originate above the ventricles, in the atria or AV node.  It\u2019s also called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, for its episodic nature \u2013 the rhythms come suddenly, and go spontaneously. In normal conduction, electrical signals are initiated in the SA node, and travel throughout the atria to reach the AV node. The AV node is the gateway to the ventricles. It delays the passage of electrical impulses to the ventricles to ensure that the atria have ejected all the blood into the ventricles before the ventricles contract.   SVT occurs when abnormal electrical pathways bypass or corrupt the AV nodal checkpoint. As a result, heart rate accelerates, and the ventricles contract before they are properly refilled. These ineffective contractions may cause lightheadedness because the brain is not getting enough oxygen. By definition, SVT includes all rhythms that originate above the ventricles. In practice, however, SVT refers only to AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT), and atrial tachycardia.  AVNRT happens when the AV nodal tissue has 2 pathways with different conductivity, one slow and one fast. If an atrial impulse arrives at the AV node when one pathway is conductive and the other is refractory, it will follow the conductive pathway. However, it may circle back through the second pathway if this becomes excitable again before the signal leaves the node. If this continues, a self-perpetuating loop, called a re-entrant pathway, may arise. With each cycle, the signal is transmitted down to the ventricles. The atrial and ventricular rates are identical, regular and fast. AVNRT is the most common type of SVT in adults, and is twice more common in women than in men. In patients with AVRT, there is an additional connection, an accessory pathway, between the atria and ventricles. The pathway acts as a shortcut to the ventricles, bypassing the AV node. It allows part of electrical impulses to arrive to the ventricles sooner, causing a so-called \u201cpre-excitation\u201d, which can be seen as a shortened PR interval on an ECG. Because part of the ventricles depolarize earlier, ventricular depolarization develops in a more gradual fashion and lasts longer, resulting in a slurring slow rise of the initial portion of the QRS complex, known as Delta wave, and QRS prolongation. However, the presence of the accessory pathway alone is not enough to cause tachycardia. AVRT develops when electrical impulses travel down one pathway, either the normal or accessory, then back up via the other, creating a loop, or re-entrant circuit. The frequency of this loop determines heart rate and can be very fast. AVRT can be orthodromic or antidromic depending on the direction of the loop. AVRT is more common in children. Atrial tachycardia is caused by an ectopic focus in an atrium, and can arise from any of the three mechanisms: enhanced automaticity, reentry, or triggered. Ventricular rhythms are regular and fast. P wave morphology varies depending on the site of origin and tachycardia mechanism. Atrial tachycardia is common in children with congenital heart disease, but it may also be triggered by environmental factors in healthy people. Because of the episodic nature of SVT, symptoms come and go and may not be present during physical examination. ECG findings may be normal, and the condition is often misdiagnosed as anxiety or panic attacks. Assessment should include continuous monitoring with a portable ECG recording device. When SVT is caused by an underlying condition, it must be treated. Most people who have no underlying disease and have an obvious trigger may not require treatment. For others, treatments and lifestyle changes can often control the condition.", "tags": ["arrhythmia", "arrhythmias", "atrial rhythms", "Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia", "atrium", "AVNRT", "cardiac arrhythmias", "cardiac conduction", "cardiac cycle", "cardio", "cardiogram", "cardiology", "cardiovascular", "classification of cardiac arrhythmia", "closed circuit", "diagnosis", "dysrhythmia", "ecg", "Ecg Interpretation", "ecg strip", "ectopic sites", "EKG", "electrical activities of the heart", "electrical activity", "electrical conduction of the heart", "fast heart rate", "health", "healthcare", "heart", "heart diseases"], "comments": 44, "likes": "1919", "channel_name": "Alila Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A", "channel_subscribers": "997000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 309.0, "keyword": "Tachycardia (fast heart rate)", "rank": 10, "consine similarity": 0.11864474946906238}

TECHNIQUE OF RESUSCITATION  After the puppy is born and removed from the sack, gently wipe the nose with cotton.  Force the haws open by pressing on the corners of the mouth and hinging the lower jaw open, then use a cotton swab to remove any fluids in the mouth.  Next, tilt the puppy to an approximate 55 degree angle to the floor with the head DOWN.  Hold the puppy with both hands, one hand over the shoulders and the other over the hindquarters.  The method of holding the puppy is all-important.  To explain further, I hold the forequarters in my right hand with the hard arched over the withers, the thumb on the shoulders and upper arm on one side, the index finger supporting the head and the middle finger holding the shoulder and upper arm on the other side.  The hindquarters are held in the left hand with the hand arched over the rump, the thumb holding the thigh, the index finger curled down over the anal area and supporting the floor of the pelvis, and the middle finger firmly holding the other thigh.  Pretend the puppy is an accordion.  The hands on the fore- and hindquarters are holding the handles.  STRETCH the puppy to its full length.  WAIT two or three seconds for the lungs to fill with air.  PUSH the puppy together to its shortest possible length.  The air should be heard leaving the lungs and often fluid is seen coming out of the mouth and/or nose.  Be sure to keep the puppy at the 55 degree angle with the head DOWN.  Repeat the STRETCH \u2013 WAIT \u2013 PUSH sequence about 12 to 14 times per minute.  The movements should be gentle but strong enough that the puppy is visibly lengthened in the stretch portion and visibly compressed and the ribs rounded up in the push portion.

Your esophagus has a ring of muscle at the end called the lower esophageal sphincter. It opens to let food into your stomach. Normally, it stays closed to prevent stomach contents from going back up into your esophagus. If the sphincter doesn't close all the way, gastroesophageal reflux or GER can happen. The weak or relaxed sphincter allows the contents of your stomach to reflux or leak back into your esophagus. Acid in the stomach contents irritates your esophagus. This can cause a painful, burning feeling in your chest called heartburn or acid indigestion. It's common to have gastroesophageal reflux once in a while. However, if it happens more than twice a week for a few weeks, you may have a more serious condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD. If left untreated, GERD can lead to complications over time. For example, you may develop esophagitis, where the lining of your esophagus becomes inflamed or irritated. Your esophagus may become too narrow, which is a condition called esophageal stricture. GERD may cause you to breathe stomach acid into your lungs. This can lead to respiratory problems such as asthma, chest congestion, hoarseness, wheezing, laryngitis, and pneumonia. GERD can also lead to a condition called Barret's esophagus. In this condition, the cells lining your lower esophagus are replaced with cells similar to those in your intestine. This may increase your risk for developing cancer in your esophagus. Common causes of GERD include being pregnant, or overweight, which puts pressure on your abdomen, smoking, certain medications such as those that treat allergies, high blood pressure, and depression, and a hiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia is a condition where the upper part of your stomach moves up through an opening in your diaphragm. This makes it easier for stomach acid to come up into your esophagus. The most common symptom of GERD is heartburn. Other symptoms include nausea, problems swallowing, bad breath, hoarseness, sore throat, and bringing food back up called regurgitation. To find out more about gastroesophageal reflux disease, talk to your healthcare provider.

During inhalation, the patient inhales through their nose as normal.  For many patients, Bongo and OptiPillow EPAP devices offer mild nasal dilation that will reduce inspiratory resistance.  During exhalation, the valve closes and air passes through a narrow opening. This creates resistance to airflow, thus increasing the backpressure in the upper airways.  There are 3 known mechanisms of action for EPAP: 1. The backpressure slows down exhalation and leads to pressure remaining in the airways at the end of the exhalation. This holds the airway wider than normal breathing.  2. This increased air in the lungs at the end of exhalation (FRC) causes a 'Tracheal Tug' reducing the susceptibility of the airways to collapse.  3. There is a slight CO2 increase.  This improves muscle tone and respiratory drive.    However, this mechanism will vary for different patients.  This is the best EPAP educational video created by Provent.", "tags": ["Provent Sleep Apnea Therapy", "How EPAP works", "EPAP"], "comments": 0, "likes": "32", "channel_name": "BMedical Pty Ltd", "chanenelID": "UCxrTOwQSnjQ8xbvG31yx9kQ", "channel_subscribers": "416", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 141.0, "keyword": "airway pressure", "rank": 25, "consine similarity": 0.14824986333222023}

This video focuses on two relaxing breathing techniques: Square breathing (aka box breathing, 4x4 breathing, 4-part breath, etc.) and Pursed breathing. More breathing exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7-CAFhJn78  \r\rI start off with Square breathing. It\u2019s so good at helping to relieve stress and anxiety that it\u2019s sometimes used in the military to help calm nerves before stressful situations.  It\u2019s performed just how it sounds--using your breath to make a square. Use imagery as well and imagine making a square or following something with a square pattern with your breath. Each position is 4 seconds. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, and hold your breath again for 4 seconds.   \r\rPursed breathing is another breathing technique that can help relieve stress and anxiety, and it can also help make your lungs stronger. For this one, use diaphragmatic or belly breathing. Breathe in for 4 seconds, and then breathe out with pursed lips for 8 seconds.

The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and be associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation.   Combining Apnoea Hypopnoea Index and oxygen desaturation gives an overall sleep apnea severity score that evaluates both the number of sleep disruptions and the degree of oxygen desaturation (low oxygen level in the blood).  The Apnoea Hypopnoea Index is calculated by dividing the number of apnea events by the number of hours of sleep.

What causes Temporomandibular Joint dysfunction (TMJD)? How can I treat it?  00:00 Introduction: 3D video of Cl\u00ednica M\u00e9dico Dental Pardi\u00f1as (http://j.mp/cPardinas) about temporomandibular  dysfunction, a problem in the joint that connects the jaw to the skull and allows us to speak and chew.  00:06 What is temporomandibular joint? It is the joint that connects the jaw to the skull and allows us to speak and chew.   00:14 What causes Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction? Problems in the temporomandibular joint may be caused by congenital abnormalities of the condyles, due to a bad form of biting or underlying problems such as teeth grinding or bruxism. Bruxism is the habit of grinding or clenching teeth, usually during sleep.  00:34 What is TMJD? Temporomandibular dysfunction is a problem in this joint and may end up causing jaw pain, headaches, neck pain, limited mouth opening and clicking when moving the jaw.  01:06 What is bruxism? Bruxism is the habit of teeth grinding, usually during sleep. More information about bruxism \ud83d\udc49 https://bit.ly/bruxismCP  01:16 What causes teeth grinding? Teeth grinding is usually caused by a state of anxiety but it can also have a genetic origin.   01:26 What are the consequences of bruxism? In the first stages, bruxism can cause wear and tooth sensitivity, and muscle and joint pain. In advanced cases, bruxism can end up causing advanced wear, tooth fractures or significant decrease in the size of the teeth.  02:43 How is bruxism treated? To identify unwanted contacts in an inadequate occlusion, articulating papers are used and molds of the patient\u2019s mouth are made. Unwanted contacts are posteriorly analyzed in order to plan the proper treatment.   03:18 What is mouth guard for? One of the possible solutions to bruxism is making a mouth guard, which is placed in the maxilla and will protect teeth and temporomandibular joint.

Here is some more information about the CPR Certification Institute:  As a Health Ed Solutions Authorized Training Center, CPR Certification Institute was created to achieve a simple goal \u2014 to make learning life-saving skills convenient and more accessible for both medical professionals and laypersons. Our commitment to providing robust training and testing options is the driving force behind our curriculum. Our courses are medically accurate, flexible, and engaging.  Our online certification courses are created by board-certified medical professionals and reviewed for accuracy by the Health Ed Solutions Medical Review Board. Each practice test is uniquely generated, and every final exam is designed to ensure you have learned all of the skills to react when there is a life-threatening emergency.  We believe that the more people who know life-saving skills, the more lives that can be saved. Our courses are created to benefit a wide range of people: high school students getting ready to graduate, nurses, physicians, medical techs, first responders, lifeguards, nursing home and daycare workers, and even the average layperson who might someday find themselves in the position of being able to offer aid during an emergency.  Being able to administer appropriate CPR or First Aid care can mean the difference between life and death. Those who do not receive CPR immediately following a cardiac event rarely make it to a hospital alive. Your quick action could mean they have a greater chance of surviving.  Our courses cover CPR and AED training, First Aid, Infant CPR, Babysitting, and Bloodborne Pathogens. We also offer the more advanced ACLS, PALS, BLS, and NRP certifications. It\u2019s a small time and cost commitment to become certified, but it can make a huge difference in someone\u2019s life. All of our certifications are 100% online and available from any mobile device or computer.  Sign up to become certified today, and join the ranks of trained lifesavers across the globe!  \u270d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcd1Visit our website for online certification and recertification courses, free learning resources, practice exams, and more. \ud83c\udf0d https://www.cprcertification.com/  \ud83d\udd14Get updates from our Social Media Accounts \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f https://www.facebook.com/CPRCertInstitute \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f https://www.instagram.com/cprcertification \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f https://twitter.com/cprcertonline \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpr-certification-institute \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f https://www.pinterest.com/cprcertification  Please subscribe to our channel and like our videos.

Body cam video captured Victoria Terrill was terrified as her son Chaz was choking on something. \"You know I was panicking, and it sucks that I didn't know what to do,\" she said Tuesday. Wheeler drove by where they had stopped, and he knew exactly what to do. After pounding him three times on the back, a quarter flew out of the boy's mouth. \"You OK, buddy?\" Wheeler asked the boy. Terrill said she's forever thankful the deputy was there. \"He literally was like a guardian angel,\" she said. \"He just happened to be going by at the exact time I needed him.\" Terrill said she plans to learn the Heimlich maneuver to avoid future accidents.

For IRDS, infants are commonly administered surfactant during mechanical ventilation, a practice that can cause lasting lung injury in preterm infants and contribute to the development of chronic lung disease. Unlike mechanical ventilation, b-CPAP is a non-invasive ventilation strategy \u2013 delivering continuous positive airway pressure to newborns to maintain lung volumes during exhalation. The oscillating, rather than constant pressure, plays a role in its safety and efficacy, minimizing physical trauma and stimulating lung growth when administered over a prolonged period.

A cough is nothing but a reflex action that clears your airway of irritants and mucus.  Types of cough: productive and nonproductive. A productive cough produces phlegm or mucus, clearing it from the lungs and a nonproductive cough doesn\u2019t produce phlegm or mucus. This nonproductive cough is commonly known as Dry cough  What are the common causes of dry cough Airway hyper-responsiveness - Asthma is one of the most common causes of dry cough other than that  GERD Postnasal drip and Viral infection can also cause dry cough Environmental irritants ACE inhibitors Whooping cough Collapsed lung Lung cancer and Heart failure   Home remedies for dry cough/ Treatment for dry cough includes: 1. Honey Honey has antibacterial and wound healing properties. It can also help to coat the throat, which reduces irritation, pain and inflammation.  2. Salt water gargle Gargling with warm salt water is one of the simplest and most effective home remedies. The salt here pulls out the mucus from your swollen and inflamed tissue.  Salt water gargling helps to relieve the discomfort and scratchy throat.  3.Humidifier: Turn on the cool mist humidifier to increase the moisture in your room. Steam from a warm shower looses the mucus and can moisturize and soothe your sore throat. You can also take a steam from hot water in any container.   4. Ginger: Ginger is very beneficial for dry cough. It can suppress the cough reflex by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways.  It also has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties which relieve pain and discomfort.  5. Thyme: Thyme contains a compound called thymol that is believed to have antispasmodic effects. It can help relax the smooth muscles of the throat. Thyme is safe for occasional use only.   6. Marshmallow root  It is used in cough syrup and in lozenges to soothe dry cough. A study found that it\u2019s an effective treatment for soothing the throat and reducing the irritation caused by dry cough. Marshmallow root also have antibacterial properties.  7. Peppermint: Peppermint contains menthol, which helps to numb nerve endings in the throat that become irritated by coughing. This may provide pain relief and reduce the urge to cough. Peppermint also helps to reduce congestion  8. Antitussive cough syrup: Antitussive cough medications work by reducing the cough reflex. This lessens the desire to cough, making them especially beneficial for dry coughs. Some antitussives contain codeine and are available by prescription only. Others are available over the counter. These typically contain active ingredients, such as dextromethorphan, camphor, or menthol   If you are not sure what\u2019s causing it, then consult your doctor to figure out the best course of treatment.

(Excessive Uncontrollable Daytime Sleepiness) - https://healthery.com/health/narcolepsy/  Presented by healthery.com  Narcolepsy affects wakefulness and sleep and it is a neurological disorder. Characteristics include uncontrollable sleepiness and randomly falling asleep. These attacks can happen at any time of the day or night and during activity. It usually starts between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can start at any age. Most fall into deep stages of REM sleep about 90 minutes after falling asleep. People with narcolepsy fall into REM sleep immediately after falling asleep.  What are the Symptoms of Narcolepsy? Being extremely sleepy during the day and interference with normal activities. Cloudy and lapse in memory, extreme exhaustion, and concentration problems and feelings of depression. As well as cataplexy, a feeling of complete muscle weakness or muscle control. This can result in slurred speech or collapsing of the body. It may be triggered by intense emotions. Hallucinations may also occur, and these can be very scary. Any of the senses can be experienced and sleep paralysis. Which involves falling asleep and the inability to prevent it or to wake up. These spells are usually short lived, and recovery is usually quick.  What Causes Narcolepsy? Scientists are unable to pinpoint the exact underlying cause of narcolepsy. They suspect that there is a multitude of causes behind the condition. Genetics are thought to influence whether an individual develops it. Additionally, the immune system is believed to play a role in narcolepsy. In some individuals, it may stem from dysfunction within the immune system. Those suffering have low levels of a neurochemical called hypocretin (orexin). Hypocretin, a neurochemical, helps the brain regulate REM sleep and wakefulness. It is believed the immune system may mistakenly attack production of hypocretin. However, not all sufferers have low levels of the neurochemical. Factors which may increase susceptibility to developing narcolepsy include: Psychological stress, hormonal fluctuations, and changes in sleep patterns. A connection between narcolepsy and a certain H1N1 vaccine has been observed. The vaccine is known as Pandemrix. However, little more is known about the specifics of the connection.  How is Narcolepsy Treated? Amphetamine drugs help control sleepiness & antidepressants regulate REM sleep. A drug called Xyrem helps with cataplexy, for better sleep. Avoid nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine to naturally avoid symptoms of narcolepsy. Scheduled naps and a regular sleep schedule can also be helpful.  How is Narcolepsy Prevented? Unfortunately, it is not preventable. However, narcoleptic attacks avoidable when a pattern is noticed. Certain events or occurrences tend to precede the attacks. Triggers tend to be sedentary and/or habitual activities. During which the brain may begin to relax and doze off. Common activities which can potentially lead to a narcolepsy attack include:   Watching TV, sitting & reading, or riding in a vehicle for more than an hour. As well as sitting and talking with someone. With constant vigilance and proper maintenance, attacks can be avoidable.  If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe!

Here are 9 amazing recommendations from top specialists on how to sleep properly to fix all of your health problems. When lullabies and chamomile tea don\u2019t help you anymore, science comes to\u00a0the rescue!   TIMESTAMPS Trouble falling asleep 0:33 Snoring 1:08 Neck pain 1:25 Waking up at night 1:40 Heartburn 1:57 Shoulder pain 2:13 Trouble waking up 2:27 Cramps and muscle spasms 2:45 Back pain 3:03  SUMMARY - If you have trouble falling asleep, refuse tea and coffee 7 hours before going to bed. It's all about caffeine. Caffeine is a psychostimulant which increases overall work efficiency and brain activity.  - If snoring torments you, go to sleep on your side with your hands under your head. Before going to bed, rinse your nose with saline to open the nasal passages. Also, avoid alcohol before bedtime. - The most common reason for neck pain is an awkward sleeping position. Also, if your neck hurts, change pillows at least once every 2 years. Choose pillows made of natural latex.  - Make sure the room temperature is around 20-22C \u2013 heat has a bad effect on your sleep. - To prevent heartburn, go to sleep on your left side with your head on a large raised pillow.  - If your shoulder hurts, go to sleep on your back, hugging your pillow. Avoid sleeping on your stomach because your shoulders protrude forward and rest in the wrong position. - Wake up every day at the same time, even on weekends. Your body must get used to waking up at the same time to adjust your biological clock. - To get rid of cramps and spasms, try massaging, warming up and stretching the muscles.

My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.

The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk.

Are there ways to minimize it? were here to help. I\u2019m Lainey with INTEGRIS Health and this is INTEGRIS Health For You.  To learn more about middle of the night insomnia and possible remedies, visit the full article on the INTEGRIS Health For You blog at INTEGRISOK.com/ForYou   It\u2019s 3 AM and you are wide awake. Bedtime was normal, you fell asleep pretty quickly but now you\u2019re wide awake.   Most of us do wake up several times a night, but we just roll over and go back to sleep, as a normal part of our sleep cycle.    Dr. Jose Colon, author of \u2018The Sleep Diet,\u2019 says \u201cNobody sleeps through the night.\u201d He says even four to six nocturnal awakenings are considered normal. \u201cThis goes back to our caveman days where one would wake up, scan the environment, make sure there are no tigers, and then go back to sleep,\u201d he says. It\u2019s only a problem if you cannot go back to sleep.   Sleep problems can be temporary, or they can be serious. It\u2019s best to tell your doctor if you have trouble falling (or staying) asleep, or if you\u2019re tired during the day. As many as 80 percent of sleep disorders go undiagnosed.    Here are some possible reasons for your middle-of-the-night insomnia:   Acid reflux.  Make adjustments to ease your reflux: eat smaller meals, don\u2019t eat late in the evening and keep your weight at a healthy level.   Distractions. Put your phone or laptop down at least an hour before bed. Instead, sip some decaf chamomile tea and snuggle in with a good book. Try a white noise machine (or app) if distracting sounds are waking you up. Blackout blinds or drapes can keep light pollution to a minimum.   Belly fat. Extra weight around your middle makes it harder to breathe when you lie down. Uneasy breathing is disruptive to sleep. Belly fat also tends to trigger inflammation in your body, which can diminish the function of the neurological pathways that control sleep   Alcohol and caffeine. Particularly late in the day or in excess, both alcohol and caffeine are fantastic sleep disruptors. Avoid caffeinated beverages late in the day and rethink drinking alcohol late at night.     Depression. One of the most common signs of depression is insomnia or an inability to stay asleep. According to a recent Johns Hopkins article, some 75 percent of people with depression have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Think you may be depressed? Talk to your INTEGRIS Health primary care provider, they can refer you to a mental health specialist who can help.   Stress. If you\u2019re experiencing stress in your life, relaxing and sleeping through the night can be tricky. Consider stress relieving techniques like meditation or yoga to help you manage stress.", "tags": ["Why Can't I Stay Asleep?", "Why Cant I Stay Asleep?", "insomnia", "cant fall asleep", "acid reflux", "depression", "stress", "i cant stay asleep", "i can't stay asleep", "why cant i stay asleep", "sleep disorder", "tips to stay asleep", "trouble staying asleep", "trouble sleeping"], "comments": 5, "likes": "30", "channel_name": "INTEGRIS Health", "chanenelID": "UCuq0v-D2ncxm4EiFy8VJNig", "channel_subscribers": "1370", "accreditationTag": 1, "duration": 150.0, "keyword": "difficulty staying asleep", "rank": 1, "consine similarity": 0.07732446730270591}

This weeks video is all about insomnia and how to treat it naturally without the use of medication.  I see many patients who have insomnia and most of the time they want sleeping tablets - But actually most pharmacists, GPs, nurse practitioners prefer not to recommend sleeping tablets. As insomnia can often be improved by changing your daytime and bedtime habits or by improving your bedroom environment.  See your GP, Pharmacist or Nurse Practitioner if you're still having difficulty getting to sleep after trying these techniques.  WHAT IS INSOMNIA? Insomnia means poor sleep. About one third of adults do not get as much sleep as they would like. Poor sleep can mean:  \u2022 Not being able to get off to sleep. \u2022 Waking up too early. \u2022 Waking for long periods in the night. \u2022 Not feeling refreshed after a night's sleep.  If you have poor sleep, particularly over a long period of time, it can severely affect your life, as it can cause:  \u2022 Tiredness (fatigue) and loss of energy in the daytime. \u2022 Poor concentration. \u2022 Loss of interest in usual activities. Irritability. \u2022 Depression and anxiety. \u2022 Inability to do things as well or as much as usual. \u2022 A worse quality of life.  WHAT IS A NORMAL AMOUNT OF SLEEP? About 6-9 hours per night is average for most adults. Most people establish a pattern that is normal for them in their early adult life. However, as you become older, it is normal to sleep less. For most people it takes less than thirty minutes to fall asleep.  So, everyone is different. What is important is that the amount of sleep that you get should be sufficient for you, and that you usually feel refreshed and not sleepy during the daytime.  HOW TO SLEEP BETTER? Insomnia can often be improved by changing your daytime and bedtime habits or by improving your bedroom environment.  Making small changes may help you to get a good night's sleep. Try some of the methods below for a few weeks to see if they help.  See your GP, Pharmacist or Nurse Practitioner if you're still having difficulty getting to sleep after trying these techniques.  DAYTIME HABITS: \u2022 Set a specific time for getting up each day. Try to stick to this time, seven days a week, even if you feel you haven't had enough sleep. This should help you sleep better at night. \u2022 Don't take a nap during the day. \u2022 Exercise daily, but don't exercise for at least four hours before going to bed.  BEDTIME HABITS: \u2022 Stop drinking tea and coffee for a few hours before bedtime. \u2022 Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking, particularly shortly before going to bed.  \u2022 Don't eat a big meal just before bedtime. \u2022 Don't use back-lit electronic devices shortly before going to bed. \u2022 Don't lie in bed feeling anxious about lack of sleep. Instead, get up, go to another room for about 20 minutes and do something else, such as reading or listening to soft music, before trying again. \u2022 Write a list of your worries and any ideas to solve them before going to bed. This may help you forget about them until the morning. \u2022 Link to relaxation techniques: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/ways-relieve-stress/?  BEDROOM ENVIRONMENT: \u2022 Use thick blinds or curtains or wear an eye mask if the early morning sunlight or bright street lamps affect your sleep. \u2022 Make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature for sleeping. \u2022 Wear ear plugs if noise is a problem. \u2022 Don't use your bedroom for anything other than sleeping or sex. Avoid watching television, making phone calls, eating or working while you're in bed. \u2022 Make sure your mattress is comfortable and that you have a pillow you like, as well as adequate bedding for the time of year.

He taught himself to be an early riser as a young SEAL after noticing that some of the best people in the field got to work before he did. \u201cI started waking up earlier so I could maybe get a little edge,\u201d he says.  CNBC Make It caught up with Willink for his tips for those training themselves to be early risers.  Listen to your body Pick a time to wake each morning and make sure that you commit to that time. If you do, you\u2019ll find yourself getting tired earlier and earlier in the evening. Give yourself that rest, he says. Go to bed earlier and earlier until you have developed a new night-time routine and a new fixed bedtime.  \u201cIt takes discipline,\u201d says Willink. \u201cWhen you make that discipline decision early in the morning, the rest of your day is going to have more discipline in it.\u201d  Don\u2019t sleep in on Saturday By the weekend, you might be tempted to sleep in. Don\u2019t, says Willink. If you do, \u201cby the time Monday morning rolls around you won\u2019t feel like waking up early.\u201d Keep your bedtime and your wake time consistent to ensure you can keep to your early rising schedule.  \u201cGet up early and get up early every day,\u201d he says.  Give yourself time to adjust Willink says people are surprised that just going to bed as early as 9:30 p.m. isn\u2019t enough to become an early riser. He says people find they can\u2019t force themselves to sleep and will often lie in bed awake until their usual bedtime, making early rising impossible.

{"id": "qGvNU_w5jn0", "title": "Dry Mouth - Causes, Symptoms, Treatments and Prevention", "views": "25608", "date_published": "2022-03-12", "description": "Saliva, or spit, is made by the salivary glands and is very important for a healthy mouth. It moistens and breaks down food, washes away food particles from the teeth and gums, and helps people with swallowing. In addition, saliva contains minerals such as calcium and phosphate that help keep teeth strong and fight tooth decay.  Dry mouth, also called xerostomia (ZEER-oh-STOH-mee-ah), is the condition of not having enough saliva to keep the mouth wet. Dry mouth can happen to anyone occasionally\u2014for example, when nervous or stressed. However, when dry mouth persists, it can make chewing, swallowing, and even talking difficult. Dry mouth also increases the risk for tooth decay or fungal infections in the mouth because saliva helps keep harmful germs in check.  Dry mouth is not a normal part of aging. If you think you have dry mouth, see your dentist or doctor to find out why your mouth is dry.  Causes There are several possible causes of dry mouth:  Side effects of some medicines. Hundreds of medicines can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva. For example, medicines for high blood pressure, depression, and bladder-control issues often cause dry mouth. Disease. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, HIV/AIDS, and diabetes can all cause dry mouth. Radiation therapy. The salivary glands can be damaged if they are exposed to radiation during cancer treatment. Chemotherapy. Drugs used to treat cancer can make saliva thicker, causing the mouth to feel dry. Nerve damage. Injury to the head or neck can damage the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva. Symptoms Symptoms of dry mouth include:  A sticky, dry feeling in the mouth. Trouble chewing, swallowing, tasting, or speaking. A burning feeling in the mouth. A dry feeling in the throat. Cracked lips. A dry, rough tongue. Mouth sores. An infection in the mouth. Bad breath. Back to top Diagnosis Your doctor or dentist will review your medical history and ask about any medications you take. He or she may also suggest blood tests or a test that measures how much saliva you produce.  Treatment Depending on the cause of your dry mouth, your health care provider can recommend appropriate treatment. For example, if medication is causing dry mouth, the doctor or dentist may advise changing medications or adjusting the dosages, or may prescribe a saliva substitute.  There are also self-care steps you can take to help ease dry mouth, such as drinking plenty of water, chewing sugarless gum, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol. Good oral care at home and regular dental check-ups will help keep your mouth healthy.", "tags": null, "comments": 20, "likes": "166", "channel_name": "Rehealthify", "chanenelID": "UCB5a4eG55pmif3c2OXodIYw", "channel_subscribers": "97800", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 217.0, "keyword": "dry mouth", "rank": 4, "consine similarity": 0.10206207261596577}

Chapters  0:00 Introduction 0:56 Causes of Dry Mouth 1:48 Symptoms of Dry Mouth 2:16 Diagnosis of Dry Mouth 2:49 Treatment of Dry Mouth   Xerostomia, also known as dry mouth,[1] is dryness in the mouth, which may be associated with a change in the composition of saliva, or reduced salivary flow, or have no identifiable cause.  This symptom is very common and is often seen as a side effect of many types of medication. It is more common in older people (mostly because this group tend to take several medications) and in persons who breathe through their mouths. Dehydration, radiotherapy involving the salivary glands, chemotherapy and several diseases can cause reduced salivation (hyposalivation), or a change in saliva consistency and hence a complaint of xerostomia. Sometimes there is no identifiable cause, and there may sometimes be a psychogenic reason for the complaint.[1] Xerostomia is the subjective sensation of dry mouth, which is often (but not always) associated with hypofunction of the salivary glands.[3] The term is derived from the Greek words \u03be\u03b7\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (xeros) meaning \"dry\" and \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 (stoma) meaning \"mouth\".[4][5] A drug or substance that increases the rate of salivary flow is termed a sialogogue.  Hyposalivation is a clinical diagnosis that is made based on the history and examination,[1] but reduced salivary flow rates have been given objective definitions. Salivary gland hypofunction has been defined as any objectively demonstrable reduction in whole and/or individual gland flow rates.[6] An unstimulated whole saliva flow rate in a normal person is 0.3\u20130.4 ml per minute,[7] and below 0.1 ml per minute is significantly abnormal. A stimulated saliva flow rate less than 0.5 ml per gland in 5 minutes or less than 1 ml per gland in 10 minutes is decreased.[1] The term subjective xerostomia is sometimes used to describe the symptom in the absence of any clinical evidence of dryness.[8] Xerostomia may also result from a change in composition of saliva (from serous to mucous).[6] Salivary gland dysfunction is an umbrella term for the presence of xerostomia, salivary gland hyposalivation,[6] and hypersalivation.", "tags": ["dry mouth sounds", "dry mouth ka ilaj", "dry mouth malayalam", "dry mouth covid", "dry mouth anxiety", "dry mouth remedy in tamil", "dry mouth home remedies", "dry mouth treatment", "dry mouth causes in hindi", "dry mouth riddim", "dry mouth at night while sleeping", "dry mouth remedy", "dry mouth sounds asmr", "dry mouth"], "comments": 14, "likes": "565", "channel_name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "channel_subscribers": "276000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 214.0, "keyword": "dry throat", "rank": 12, "consine similarity": 0.0575435337648436}

Triggers that bring on a dry cough are pollution, irritants and allergens in the environment, and sometimes even a sinus infection.  The back of the throat gets irritated or inflamed, leading to dryness and coughing.   There is no mucus or phlegm in a dry cough, making the thought itchy and leading to a persistent cough.  This makes the body totally fatigued and compromises the immune system.  Take a glass of warm water. Squeeze the juice of a lime and add to it. Now add one or two teaspoon of honey.  Mix this well. Drink this concoction a couple of times a day till the cough lasts.  Honey is a natural home remedy for a dry cough, as it soothes the irritated tissue lining at the back of the throat. Depending on the severity of the cough, you can take a tablespoon of honey one to three times a day.  In a bowl, take 10 tablespoons of coconut milk. Add one tablespoon of poppy seeds, or khuskhus, to the coconut milk. Also add in one tablespoon of honey. Mix well and take this mixture at night before going to sleep.   Soak seven almonds in warm water overnight. Next morning, peel the skin of the almonds. Now make a paste of the almonds by crushing them. To this add two tablespoons of butter. Add in two tablespoons of sugar and mix well. You can have this paste twice a day till you get relief.  In a glass of slightly warm water, add a tsp each of turmeric or haldi. Now stir in one tsp of carom, or ajwain powder. Mix this well and have a couple of times a day till the cough persists. Eat healthy and drink healthy to lead a good life.

And new research looks even further into how sleep actually helps us maintain clean brains\u2014but what does that mean?  Building on a study from 2013, a team of researchers at Boston University explored what makes sleep so special.  The team got human participants to fall asleep inside an fMRI machine, which allowed researchers to measure the blood oxygen levels in the participants\u2019 brains and show the flux of cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. The researchers also measured the electrical currents in subjects\u2019 brains using an EEG.   CSF is a watery, clear substance that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a little cushion that protects the brain and provides it with nutrients.  Over the years, researchers have discovered more about not only the brain's sleep phases, but also how those phases are essential to information processing and memory formation.   It\u2019s not just during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep that the brain consolidates information and commits it to long-term memory. Brains do this during nonREM sleep, too.  In humans, these two states of sleep\u2014REM and nonREM\u2014alternate throughout the night. NonREM sleep is divided into 3 stages, with the third stage being our deepest state of sleep, called slow wave sleep.   And slow wave sleep in particular is essential to clearing out all the gunk in our brains.  In this Elements, we explore how slow wave sleep helps rid your brain of toxins and what this research could mean for future efforts to  combat neurodegenerative diseases.  #sleepstudy #brain #neurology #REM #humanbody #Seeker #Elements #Science  SICK Playlist - http://bit.ly/SICKplaylist ____________________  Read More:  Coupled electrophysiological, hemodynamic, and cerebrospinal fluid oscillations in human sleep https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6465/628  \"We used accelerated neuroimaging to measure physiological and neural dynamics in the human brain.

We all do it, but what happens to us when we sleep?  Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy   Every night almost everyone on the planet enters into a state of unconsciousness and paralysis - but what is really happening inside the body when we drift off, and what's the impact if we don't get enough sleep?  Sleep is regulated by your circadian rhythm, or body clock located in the brain. The body clock responds to light hews ramping up production of the hormone melatonin at night, and switching it off when it senses light.   There are four stages of sleep that the body experiences in cycles throughout the night. On a good night we cycle through these stages four or five times.   Stages one and two are light sleep. This is a transition from being awake to falling asleep. Heart rate and breathing begin to slow, body temperature falls, and muscles may twitch. Stage 3 is sometimes referred to as Delta sleep - because of the slow Delta brainwaves that are released during this stage. This is the first stage of deep sleep where our cells produce the most growth hormone to service bones and muscles, allowing the body to repair itself. Stage 4 is where we begin to dream. The body creates chemicals that render it temporarily paralyzed so that we do not act out our dreams. In this stage, the brain is extremely active and our eyes, although closed, dark back and forth as if we were awake.  Humans roughly spend one third of their lives asleep. Modern lifestyles, stress and the proliferation of Technology, mean that people is sleeping far less today than they were a century ago.   Sleeping less than seven hours per day is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions which could reduce life expectancy.

A good night's sleep is priceless. You feel rejuvenated with it, or feel out of gas without it. The reason has to do with a housekeeping system that the brain uses to get rid of toxins that could be dangerous to health. Han Da-eun explains further... the importance of getting your Zs.  Sleep is essential for health, but why exactly do we need to sleep? One of the reasons is to clear toxins from the brain. During waking hours, toxins build up in the brain, which can interfere with memory and learning. But when we sleep, the brain flushes these neurotoxins out through the glymphatic system.   \"The glymphatic system is activated during sleep. Brain cells shrink to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean.\"  Back in 2013, a team at the University of Rochester Medical Center that did studies on mice... found that the glymphatic system became ten times more active when the mice were asleep. And last year, UC Berkeley scientists found that the build-up of toxic proteins caused by a lack of sleep... can damage the brain,... potentially contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease. We spend about a third of our lives sleeping, and sleep plays a direct role in the other two-thirds of our lives, so it's easy to see just how important a good night's sleep can be.

When you are stressed or anxious, you can\u2019t \u201clet go\u201d enough to relax fully and achieve that full muscular stretch, causing a feeling of annoyance or dissatisfaction with the yawn.  When you yawn, you end up stretching a lot of muscles in the face and the chest, limbs, and abdomen. This stretching sends signals to the part of the brain associated with experiencing good sensations. Being stressed or anxious can prevent completing these actions.  The Thompson Cortisol hypothesis suggests that cortisol, a hormone that plays an important role in stress, is briefly elevated when one yawns. Excessive yawning may be a sign of stress and anxiety, leading to an incomplete yawn in conjunction with an unconscious inability to let go.  If you are stressed or anxious, you will not fully relax and achieve this full muscle stretch, which will make you feel angry or dissatisfied with yawning.  #science #funfacts #yawns  References: https://askdruniverse.wsu.edu/2015/11/23/why-is-yawning-contagious/ https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/228262 https://eigsti.psy.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/664/2014/05/Helt2010-yawning.pdf https://today.uconn.edu/2010/09/when-yawning-isnt-contagious/ https://www.i-jmr.org/2012/2/e4  Original Article Link: https://www.scienceabc.com/eyeopeners/why-cant-you-always-complete-yawns.html  If you wish to buy/license this video, please write to us at admin@scienceabc.com.

How many times a week do you get up when your alarm rings, without hitting the snooze button?  Nothing is worse than going to bed early, only to wake up still feeling exhausted. There are number of factors that affect how tired you feel in the morning, and you probably have some habits that are robbing you of your energy.   We'll look at some of the solutions that you should adopt, which will help you wake up early and well rested.   1 .STOP SNOOZING  When you snooze, you\u2019re not really getting more sleep. It doesn\u2019t make you feel better about waking up. It actually does nothing beneficial for you. Every single time you hit the snooze button you wake up feeling more tired.  2.GET ENOUGH SLEEP  We need a certain amount of sleep every day for our body to function properly. You should go to sleep and wake up at the same time seven days per week. This way your body gets into the rhythm and you can wake up naturally at the end of a sleep cycle, every single day.  3.RE-HYDRATE AND GET THE BLOOD FLOWING  It's crucial that you hydrate yourself first thing in the morning. After 6 to 8 hours without water, you'll naturally be dehydrated, and dehydration causes fatigue. Another important thing to do, is some light exercise as soon as you wake up.  It may seem counter intuitive, but researchers say expending energy by engaging in regular exercise, doesn't make you tired, it actually creates energy in your body.  4.AVOID SCREENS BEFORE BED  Your TV, smart phone and computer screen all produce artificial blue light. The problem with artificial light in the evening, is that it tricks your body in to thinking that it's actually day time.  When it gets darker outside, your body naturally produces a sleep hormone called melatonin. Since artificial light blocks melatonin production, we can really mess up our sleep, because your body doesn't send signals to your cells that's it's night time.  Apps mentioned:  Sleep Cycle - Alarm that wakes you up when at the end of your sleep phase F.lux - Orange screen for your computer Twilight - Orange screen for your phone  *Disclaimer*  If these tips don't help, you might have a medical problem. If so, you should see a doctor immediately. Things such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or sleep apnea, are more common than you might think and will affect how tired you feel.", "tags": ["stop feeling tired", "stop feeling tired animated", "how to stop feeling tired", "always tired", "tired in the morning", "waking up tired", "waking up feeling tired", "tired every morning", "tired every morning animated", "better than yesterday", "stop feeling tired every morning", "stop feeling tired in the morning", "how to stop waking up tired", "waking up tired animated", "always feeling tired", "stop feeling tired tips", "waking up tired tips", "tired every morning tips", "better than yesterday animated"], "comments": 4459, "likes": "286558", "channel_name": "Better Than Yesterday", "chanenelID": "UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ", "channel_subscribers": "2130000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 330.0, "keyword": "grogginess", "rank": 11, "consine similarity": 0.0}

What Happens When Your Eyes Don\u2019t Have Equal Sight", "views": "84092", "date_published": "2019-02-04", "description": "Anisometropia is an eye condition where someone\u2019s eyes have unequal refractive power (the degree where the eye differentiates light).  This condition hurts your eye\u2019s ability to focus and can cause severe headaches. Evan Kaufman, MD, explains this condition and how UVA treats patients with anisometropia.   For more information visit https://uvahealth.com/services/eye-care  In Evan Kaufman's words: With anisometropia, one eye might see perfectly while the other eye doesn\u2019t see well at all. Since eyes work together to see, if one eye is in focus and the other eye is not, a discrepancy occurs in the brain. The brain then tells the eye with the poorer vision to shut down. This will become amblyopic (decreased eyeslight), or you get a really big headache. We see a lot of strenuous headaches and people that have anisometropia. You can help people with glasses with an uneven prescription. The problem that we have with glasses is the further away you put your refractive surface from the eye, it changes the image that is seen. What I mean by that is if you think about Sherlock Holmes and his magnifying glass, he uses his magnifying glass to find clues or to magnify things. Well, if one eye has a magnifying glass on it, which is your prescription, and the other eye does not have a magnifying glass, then one eye sees things that are really big and the other eye sees things that are normal size. And when you have that size discrepancy, you can get a really bad headache. Contact lenses can sit right on top of the eye. Now, when you deal with magnification, because the contact lens sits right up against the eye, the refractive surface is up against the eye. And whether the prescription\u2019s a minus 10 or a plus 20, because it sits on the eye, the distance that the light has to travel to hit the eye is 0 because it's sitting on the eye. Thus, the magnification or minification is 0, so you have zero-size discrimination when you wear contact lenses in a case of a patient that has anisometropia.", "tags": ["uva", "uva health", "anisometropia", "eye vision", "eye health", "Ophthalmologist", "anisometropia treatment", "anisometropia glasses", "eye conditions", "eye conditions and treatment", "university of virginia", "vision", "uva doctors"], "comments": 176, "likes": "1006", "channel_name": "uvahealth", "chanenelID": "UCAUMuw4KF1mPdOlxaAbTDmw", "channel_subscribers": "10300", "accreditationTag": 1, "duration": 133.0, "keyword": "inability to concentrate", "rank": 11, "consine similarity": 0.0}

{"id": "2NTYS0BBF9A", "title": "Sleep Paralysis: Do You Ever Wake Up And Can't Move?", "views": "765665", "date_published": "2019-04-30", "description": "In a perfect world, everyone would be able to fall asleep the second their head hits the pillow, stay asleep all night, and wake up feeling completely refreshed. Unfortunately, for many people, this isn't the case. Many people struggle to fall asleep at night, and others wake up several times during the night. There are some people whose sleeping issues are much more frightening. Sleep paralysis: Do you ever wake up and cant move?  There is a very scary phenomenon called sleep paralysis. People who suffer from this condition wake up and are unable to move their body at all. What could be scarier than being completely paralyzed when you wake up. You don't know why it is happening or when you will start getting any feeling back. There are some people whose condition is so serious that they wake up feeling like there is someone sitting on top of their chest.   The idea of sleep paralysis is terrifying. Many people don't have it or know anyone who does; however, it is more common than you think. According to a 2011 study, 7.6 percent of the population has this sleeping disorder.   When you hear people describe sleep paralysis, they talk about the inability to move. They also talk about an unusual presence lurking in the room. These descriptions make it easy to understand how scary this condition is. It may be scary, but it isn't a sign of any medical issues. It also isn't dangerous. It might be terrifying, but you cannot die from it.  The reason that people suffer from sleep paralysis is unclear. However, doctors believe that it is due to the interruption of the transition of different sleep stages. During the REM stage of sleep, which stands for rapid eye movement, the body goes into a paralyzed state called REM atonia. This is what keeps people from moving and acting violently reacting to their dreams. REM atonia protects your body while your dreams set in. People who have sleep paralysis remain in the REM atonia stage even after they wake up. This makes it impossible to move your body when you are awake.   There are three main categories of hallucinations that people with sleep paralysis describe. Everyone with the condition suffers one of the three. The first one is the Incubus. When a person suffers from this type, they will feel intense pressure on their chest. It often feels like someone is sitting on top of them, and it makes breathing difficult. Researchers believe that this is just the mind playing tricks. Walking up feeling this pressure can be scary, which makes it difficult to breathe.   People who experience this symptom often see a shadowy figure lurking in their bedroom as they slip into sleep paralysis. There isn't anyone there, obviously. Experts believe that this is a hypervigilant state of the midbrain. This means that the brain perceives even the slighted stimuli as a threat. A typical sound can cause a person in sleep paralysis to become terrified.   Some people with sleep paralysis report feeling as though they have levitated out of their own body and they are hovering over it. During the REM stage of sleep, there are parts of the brain that inhibit movement while you are sleeping and they become activated. According to Daniel Denis, a cognitive neuroscience researcher, you feel like your moving because the area of the brain that coordinates is overactive.  Preventing sleep paralysis and breaking out of it can be difficult, but it is possible. First, to avoid the phenomenon altogether is to avoid sleeping on your back. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. It is difficult to stay on your side while you are sleeping. If you wake up and you are in paralysis, you should focus on your muscles. You are going to be scared so this might be hard, but if you can concentrate on moving a muscle, even just the slightest movement in your finger, it can break the paralysis. Finally, sleep deprivation can cause sleep paralysis; therefore, you should strive to get 8-hours of sleep each night.   While anyone can have sleep paralysis, there are a few conditions that put a person at greater risk. People with bipolar are especially susceptible to this phenomenon. The same is true with people who have narcolepsy. If you suffer from frequent leg cramps, you are also at risk.  While sleep paralysis can be terrifying, the good news is that if you have it, you will be fine. Nobody has ever died during a sleep paralysis episode. If you let it run its course, you will be able to move again, and you can go on with your day. Like this content?

In this video, Jeffrey E. Baylor, M.D., F.A.C.S., a board-certified otolaryngologist at the Ear, Nose, Throat & Plastic Surgery Associates describes what a mandibular advancement device is and how it can help prevent loud snoring and sleep apnea.  \u201cA mandibular advancement device - what is that?\u201d asks Dr. Baylor. \u201cIt is a device for people who have mild sleep apnea or loud snoring that they haven't been able to treat in other ways. A mandibular advancement device allows your jaw to be pushed forward while you sleep. When your lower jaw gets pushed forward, it allows better breathing room for the back of the throat. It keeps your tongue from falling backward. It also keeps your palate from falling backward and making the snoring sound.\u201d  \u200b\u201dMandibular advancement devices need to be fitted properly,\u201d says Dr. Baylor. \u201cYou may see a lot of them on the internet, and they're usually quite inexpensive online. Unfortunately, they don't work very well. Many of my patients will come in saying that they tried them (online) and they don't work. The problem is, is that when mandibular advancement devices are not fitted correctly, at the least, they don't work right, but at the worst, they can (negatively) affect your jaw joint.\u201d  \u201cMandibular advancement devices should be fitted professionally,\u201d says Dr. Baylor. \u201cThis is something we do here in the office. \u200bWe have different devices that we use. Most of our devices are called TAP devices. They're fairly low profile so that when you wear them in your mouth, they are not going to be obvious.

It is simple just as the word says. Mouth breathing means breathing through the mouth, instead of the nasal passages. Well normally all individuals breathe through the nasal passages and in certain conditions that is addressed. In certain conditions like when there is excessive exertion or an exercise, then there would be breathing through the nose and a little bit through the mouth. Now let\u2019s go to the causes. The actual causes of mouth breathing will be divided into obstructive and habitual. Obstructive causes will be several. Simple allergies probably due to dust or any other substance allergies that can cause rhinitis or blockage in the nasal passages also may lead to mouth breathing. Also in cases of enlarged adenoids, enlarged tonsils or a deviated nasal septum, all may cause mouth breathing. Early detection of mouth breathing is very important. So observation of a child while breathing, while playing is very important. So these are the causes and very basically the causes of mouth breathing, certain anatomic causes would be a short upper lip, were the patient is not able to close the mouth completely at rest, we would say call that incompetent lips. In that case it may lead to mouth breathing.

Most parents don't even realize that often they are inadvertently causing their newborn to wake sooner than they need to. In this video you'll learn what this change is and how you can implement it right away for better newborn sleep.  The key to understanding why this works is understanding how newborn sleep is different from our sleep as adults. A baby's brain is developing at a rapid pace, and as a result their sleep behaviors and patterns are still developing and changing as well.  In the video you'll learn why this aspect of newborn sleep is so important, and how to accommodate for that next time your baby takes a nap.  If you're struggling with your newborn baby waking frequently and taking short naps, this video might be exactly what you need!  \u2705 Get your free New Parent's Guide to Naps here: https://brightestbeginning.com/nap-guide/  \ud83d\udc76 Learn how to make sure your baby hits their crucial developmental milestones in their first 6 months with my course, Bright Beginnings: https://brightestbeginning.com/courses/bright-beginnings/  \ud83d\udcf1 Follow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightest.beginning/  \u2615 Just want to say thanks?

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep apnea and is believed to affect approximately 4% of men and 2% of women. However, it is believed that only about 10% of people with OSA seek treatment leaving the majority of OSA sufferers undiagnosed.  Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by partial or complete blockage of the airways during sleep. During sleep, a person's throat muscles relax allowing the tongue and/or fatty tissues of the throat to fall back into the airways and block airflow. During an apnea event air is restricted from moving beyond the obstruction reducing blood flow to the brain. This in turn signals the brain to partially awaken from sleep to signal the body that it needs to breathe. This is often followed by a loud gasping, choking, or snorting sounds as the person takes a deep enough breath to fight past the obstruction.  Once a breath is taken the brain returns to sleep, and the process begins once again. This process can occur just a few times a night or hundreds of times a night depending on the severity of the condition.

Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.  The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.  You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils or adenoids may also get it.  Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.  When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.

Well, I feel tired at school it's hard to wake up. I've been finding her very irritable during the days.A little bit cranky. Falling asleep in the afternoon and when she's sleeping she's snoring and sometimes they hear her gasp for breath. Sounds a lot like she might have obstructive sleep apnea. So the only way for us to know for sure is to do something called a sleep study. So I'll go ahead and get that organized. What's a sleep study? What a great question.  Let me tell you a little bit about it. So one of the days after dinner when we arrange it you'll come with your mom or your dad. I open to the sleep lab so that we can get information while you're sleeping and then in the morning you get to go home. It sounds just like a sleepovers. You love sleepovers. You can bring your pillow and your book and make yourself comfortable. So sleep study test is to look for any problems that occur during sleep such as sleep apnea and sleep apnea occurs when you snore and may have pauses in breathing during the night causing sleep fragmentation.   Nice to meet you. Welcome to the sleep lab. My name is Colin. I'll be your sleep technologist today. I'll be taking care of you. So what the sleep study test will do we'll put a band around the chest to look for breathing movements. The thing about them is they have to be relatively tight because they're a lot easier to loosen. Once they aren't, you then to taking them. So I'm gonna make it pretty tight but then we'll loosen it until you're comfortable ok.   What the sleep study test will do is we will put eg leads and on the head to measure the brainwaves. We'll also put on EKG leads to measure the heart rate and the rhythm. I will put on a probe and on the finger to measure oxygen levels.   The goal for our sleep study is generally to determine whether a child has sleep disorder breathing and to what degree. At that point we would determine the best management plan for the patient be it surgical or therapeutic. So if your child is diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, the first step would be to move forward with an ear nose and throat assessment for the size of the adenoids and tonsils. And if in fact the adenoids and tonsils are enlarged, then we would recommend an adenoidtonsillectomy. In general after that tonsils energy not being removed we'll do another sleep study four to six months after the surgery to see if the surgery fix the problem completely.  Throughout the night. Mom is right there. You can wake her up tell her to come get me. If you don't feel comfortable coming out in the hallway, there's a little button right there just press that little button on the wall and it sends a beep into my office if you need anything.   Okay. Also, you are on candid camera tonight. I will be watching you sleep. I will be checking in on you to make sure you're safe and that sort of thing okay? Morning. How did you sleep? How do you feel right now? Good? You ready to get all that stuff off your face? If still there are problems with sleep apnea, we will bring the family to the clinic to discuss other treatment options.", "tags": ["sleep study", "polysomnogram", "what happens during a sleep study", "what happens during a polysomnogram", "sleep studies for children", "should i take my child for a sleep study", "sleep apnea", "sleep apnea in children", "sleep clinic", "child always tired", "snoring", "my child snores", "obstructive sleep apnea", "sleep study test", "does my child have sleep apnea", "sleep disorder", "positive airway pressure", "does my child have a sleep disorder", "sleep disorders in children", "sleep disorder test"], "comments": 2, "likes": "27", "channel_name": "AboutKidsHealth", "chanenelID": "UCvHCw-Pc9Cl9VeZrvEVldEw", "channel_subscribers": "57900", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 242.0, "keyword": "sleep study", "rank": 14, "consine similarity": 0.08481889296799709}

Many obese patients tell me they have a hard time sleeping. Often, they are surprised when I explain they may have a medical condition called sleep apnea, a chronic disease that commonly affects very overweight people.  People with thick necks are particularly prone to this serious health risk, specifically men with a neck circumference of 17 inches or greater.  Sleep apnea sufferers never get a good night's sleep, even if they use a C-Pap, a cumbersome but effective device to help regulate breathing during the night.  You may have heard about a tragic commuter train accident that happened in New Jersey a few years ago. The engineer of the train was obese and it was suggested that he may have fallen asleep while driving the train.  Not surprisingly, when you are exhausted from poor sleep, your body may need to sleep during the day, a dangerous side effect for you and others, if you are operating a car or other machinery.  Bariatric weight loss surgery has been particularly helpful in mitigating sleep apnea and putting it into permanent remission.   There are few things more pivotal to a high quality of life than a good night's sleep. If you suspect you may be suffering from sleep apnea, see your doctor to schedule a sleep study and obtain a diagnosis.  In addition, losing excess weight can help minimize or eliminate sleep disorder symptoms and a plethora of other serious health risks. snoring exhaustion cpap weight gain", "tags": ["sleep apnea", "sleep apnea mask", "sleep apnea machine", "sleep disorders", "bariatric surgery", "weight loss surgery options", "weight loss", "large neck", "snoring", "cpap", "sleep study", "weight gain", "exhaustion", "tired", "sleepy", "sleeping at last", "sleep", "overweight", "weight loss benefits", "benefits of bariatric surgery", "obstructive sleep apnea", "obesity", "before and after", "sleeve gastrectomy", "sleep apnea symptoms", "health", "breathing", "stop breathing", "sleep deprived", "sleep deprivation effects"], "comments": 29, "likes": "112", "channel_name": "Prime Surgicare \u2014 Seun Sowemimo MD, FACS, FASMBS", "chanenelID": "UCcoJH61R6MhtMxNZqFPgAaw", "channel_subscribers": "5050", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 128.0, "keyword": "stopped breathing during sleep", "rank": 2, "consine similarity": 0.09794042137487835}

I\u2019m Doctor Michael Katsaros with the Washington Center for Dentistry and, if you are a tooth grinder, there are solutions out there for you.  First off, we want to try to help suggest controlling anxiety or possibly a sleep test to see if it\u2019s linked to an airway obstruction at night time. Some people can have an obstructed sleep airway and we want to make sure that we can help them with that.  For the typical tooth grinder, we can make a guard \u2013 as most people call it. It\u2019s really a muscle deprogramming appliance. It\u2019s a piece of resin plastic that is very comfortably fabricated for your teeth. It\u2019s custom-made in a way so that you can wear it. The most important thing is that you\u2019re compliant because tooth grinding doesn\u2019t just go away.   So, we make this appliance out of this resin material. We place it in your mouth and, at night time, it prevents you from putting all those deep forces on your teeth. So, that\u2019s how you take care of tooth grinding.   I hope this has been helpful for you.
