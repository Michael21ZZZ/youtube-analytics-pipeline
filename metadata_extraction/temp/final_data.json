Chapters  0:00 Introduction 0:54 Types of Parasomnia 1:35 Causes of Parasomnia 2:11 Symptoms 2:44 Diagnosis for Parasomnia 3:12 Treatment of Parasomnia   Parasomnias are a category of sleep disorders that involve abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, and dreams that occur while falling asleep, sleeping, between sleep stages, or during arousal from sleep. Parasomnias are dissociated sleep states which are partial arousals during the transitions between wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep, and their combinations. The newest version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, 3rd. Ed.) uses State Dissociation as the paradigm for parasomnias.[1][2] Unlike before, where wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were considered exclusive states, research has shown that combinations of these states are possible and thus, may result in unusual unstable states that could eventually manifest as parasomnias or as altered levels of awareness.[1][3][4][5][6][7]  Although the previous definition is technically correct, it contains flaws. The consideration of the State Dissociation paradigm facilitates the understanding of the sleep disorder and provides a classification of 10 core categories.[1][2] NREM parasomnias are arousal disorders that occur during stage 3 (or 4 by the R&K standardization) of NREM sleep\u2014also known as slow wave sleep (SWS). They are caused by a physiological activation in which the patient's brain exits from SWS and is caught in between a sleeping and waking state. In particular, these disorders involve activation of the autonomic nervous system, motor system, or cognitive processes during sleep or sleep-wake transitions.[8]  Some NREM parasomnias (sleep-walking, night-terrors, and confusional arousal) are common during childhood but decrease in frequency with increasing age. They can be triggered in certain individuals, by alcohol, sleep deprivation, physical activity, emotional stress, depression, medications, or a fevered illness. These disorders of arousal can range from confusional arousals, somnambulism, to night terrors. Other specific disorders include sleepeating, sleep sex, teeth grinding, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome, and somniloquy.", "tags": ["parasomnia", "parasomnia caught on camera", "parasomnia treatment", "parasomnia sleep disorder", "parasomnia movie", "parasomnia smell", "parasomnia in hindi"], "comments": 6, "likes": "79", "channel_name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "channel_subscribers": "276000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 241.0, "keyword": "Dyssomnias", "rank": 4, "consine similarity": 0.0}

Polycythemia may be a \u201crelative polycythemia\u201d resulting from dehydration or volume contraction or an \u201cabsolute polycythemia\u201d where there is an increase in the number of red cells. Absolute polycythemia may be primary or secondary.  Primary Polycythemia (or polycythemia vera) is caused by a mutation in the kinase that stimulates red blood cell production i.e. the JAK2V617F mutation. Patients can be tested for this mutation, which is positive in 80-95% of patients with polycythemia vera. Secondary polycythemia is due to conditions such as sleep apnea or hypoxia that stimulate erythropoietin (EPO) to produce red cells. Inappropropriate erythropoietin production is seen in patients with rare tumours. Medications such as synthetic EPO and testosterone can also stimulate red cell production.  Patients with polycythemia vera can be asymptomatic. However they often suffer   Hyperviscosity symptoms (headaches, vertigo, burning at the extremities)or Thrombotic symptoms such a deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, hepatic vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke or digital infarcts/critical limb ischemia.  Patients may also have symptoms of gout, heartburn or pruritus due to excessive histamine release from mast cells. Patients can also have bleeding symptoms.  Once a diagnosis of polycythemia is made, a referral to a hematologist for further management is appropriate. Medications that may be contributing to polycythemia must be stopped. Smoking cessation can often normalize hemoglobin levels, and this must be strongly encouraged in a patients with all forms of polycythemia.   In patients with polycythemia vera, therapeutic phlebotomy is indicated to reduce the hematocrit to 45%: ASA 81 mg a day is started and a cytoreductive agent such as hydroxyurea may be initiated by a hematologist.   The primary care provider has a role in managing cardiac risk factors in patients with polycythemia (hypertension, hyperlipidemia and glycemic control) as the most common cause of death in patients with polycythemia is due to thrombotic complications.", "tags": ["medskl.com", "FOAMEd", "clinical", "animation", "medical", "school", "CME"], "comments": 0, "likes": "566", "channel_name": "Medskl.com", "chanenelID": "UC54htze_JB0zz9H6oAbMOJQ", "channel_subscribers": "80100", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 211.0, "keyword": "Elevated hematocrit", "rank": 3, "consine similarity": 0.10101525445522107}

The most common complaints include nasal congestion, chronic pain or pressure over the face or eyes, no fever, and no purulent drainage. The headaches typically are between the eyes, forehead, cheeks, or all these regions. Other symptoms that may or may not be present, include light and/or noise sensitivity, pain worsening with movement, nausea and/or vomiting, runny nose, and watery eyes. These headaches last ~4-72 hours, with or without antibiotics, and occurs regularly, up to several times a month.  However, the reality is that ~80% of such patients are actually suffering from migraines or some other type of neurologic condition.

Doghramji, MD, FAAFP  The educational design of this activity addresses the needs of primary care providers (PCPs), sleep specialists, and other clinicians involved in the identification and ongoing treatment of patients with non\u201324-hour sleep-wake disorder (non-24 disorder). Non-24 disorder is an intrinsic circadian rhythm disorder characterized by cyclic desynchronization between the patient\u2019s endogenous physiologic rhythms and the earth\u2019s 24-hour light/dark cycle. Although most affected individuals are totally blind and completely lack the daily entrainment signal provided by light, recent research has suggested that the disorder is more common than previously appreciated in partially blind patients, and\u2014albeit still rare\u2014in sighted teenagers and young adults. Delays or even complete failures in the diagnosis of non-24 disorder are all too common, in part because patients do not proactively discuss sleep problems with their clinicians. Time-constrained providers also may not specifically probe for the presence of the cardinal symptoms of excessive sleepiness and insomnia, even in high-risk cohorts. Clinicians are further challenged to individualize evidence-based treatment regimens, especially because the recently updated national practice parameters on managing intrinsic circadian rhythm disorders do not fully integrate the only agent that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of non-24 disorder. This online Point-of-Care 101 (POC101) program has been built around a 3D animation and lively discussions between 2 sleep medicine experts on the pathophysiologic basis of non-24 disorder, actionable diagnostic recommendations, nonpharmacologic treatment approaches, and the latest evidence for pharmacologic modalities.

Psychiatry \u2013 Sleep Disorders Whiteboard Animation Transcript with Elliott Lee, MD https://medskl.com/Course/Detail/psychiatry  Sleep problems can be divided into complaints that people have:  1. One of the most common complaints is excessive daytime sleepiness. There are generally 5 major causes for excessive daytime sleepiness\u2026  \u2026the most common of which is an insufficient quantity of sleep. Many medical students suffer from this!  Next is a poor quality of sleep. Environmental disturbances (such as light, partner, pet), or other intrinsic sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder could be involved.   Thirdly, and less common, is a pathologic disorder of sleepiness during the day, including narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.   Fourthly, a medical or psychiatric disorder, such as a thyroid condition, cancer, medication side effect, or mood disorder can present with sleepiness.  Finally, a circadian rhythm disorder such as shift work, or jet lag could also be a culprit.  2. On the other hand, sometimes patients complain of difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, or \u201cinsomnia\u201d. This symptom can be a primary disorder on its own, but is usually the result of, or exacerbated by one or a combination of four factors:   An acute stressor.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. A skeletal muscle contracts only when stimulated by nerve impulses from a motor neuron.  The axon of a motor neuron usually gives out many branches, supplying multiple muscle fibers. These fibers  constitute a motor unit. Small motor units are found in muscles that require finer control, for example, muscles that are responsible for subtle movements of the eyes. Large motor units are found in larger muscles that require strength, such as muscles of the arms and legs. The strength of a muscle contraction is determined by the number of motor units that are activated at one time. Even at rest, most muscles are in a partial contraction state, called muscle tonus, which is maintained by alternating activation of a small number of motor units.  The connection between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber is called a neuromuscular junction, which is basically a chemical synapse between the nerve terminal and a specialized area of muscle cell membrane called the motor end-plate. When an action potential reaches the nerve terminal, it causes the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic space. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on the end-plate. Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels. Upon binding to acetylcholine, they open to allow sodium to enter the cells, depolarizing the cell membrane, producing the so-called end-plate potential.  An action potential is generated in the muscle cell only when the end-plate potential reaches the threshold required to activate voltage-gated sodium channels located outside the end-plate, in the neighboring membrane. When activated, these channels allow faster influx of sodium, further depolarizing and eventually reversing the polarity of the cell membrane. At this point, voltage-gated potassium channels open for potassium to move out, quickly returning membrane voltage to its original resting value.  Once generated, the action potential spreads like a wave thanks to similar voltage-gated ion channels located throughout the muscle fiber.  The action potential also runs deep into the fiber via T-tubules, to reach the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Here, it activates voltage-gated calcium channels, releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol of muscle cells. Calcium then sets off muscle contraction by the \u201csliding filament mechanism\u201d. This mechanism is described in another video. Another important component of the neuromuscular junction is the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme removes all acetylcholine molecules that do not immediately bind with a receptor and those that are done activating a receptor. The enzyme action essentially terminates synaptic activation, giving the muscle time to relax, and thus preventing continuous contraction that would result in muscle spasms. Substances that cause muscle weakness or paralysis do so by interfering with the function of neuromuscular junction:  - Botulinum toxin prevents acetylcholine release from the presynaptic side of the junction.   - Some other toxins attach to nicotinic receptor, blocking acetylcholine from binding, but do not open the ion channel.  - Certain drugs lodge into the channel of nicotinic receptor, blocking the passage of sodium.  All these substances prevent activation of muscle cells and cause flaccid paralysis. On the other hand, some pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase, preventing degradation of acetylcholine, causing continuous activation of muscles. That\u2019s how they induce muscle spasms and cause spastic paralysis.", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "axon", "motor unit", "muscle contraction", "muscle tonus", "neuromuscular junction", "chemical synapse", "motor endplate", "action potential in skeletal muscle", "Ach", "AChE", "nicotinic receptors", "ligand-gated ion channels", "EPP", "end-plate potential", "voltage-gated sodium channel", "T-tubules", "SR", "muscle spasms", "paralysis", "causes", "mechanism of action toxins", "pesticides", "medical", "neurobiology", "neurology", "neuron electrophysiology", "neuroscience", "science", "curare", "snake venom", "local anesthetics"], "comments": 68, "likes": "6915", "channel_name": "Alila Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A", "channel_subscribers": "997000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 289.0, "keyword": "NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASES", "rank": 19, "consine similarity": 0.0}

Chapters   0:00 Introduction  1:58 Causes of Obesity  3:32 Symptoms of Obesity  3:58 Diagnosis of Obesity  4:48 Treatment of Obesity     Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to an extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over 30 kg/m2; the range 25\u201330 kg/m2 is defined as overweight.Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis, and depression.  Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not medically supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.", "tags": ["Obesity epidemic in america", "Obesity documentary bbc", "Obesity documentary uk", "Obesity documentary", "Obesity epidemic documentary", "Obesity treatment in homeopathy", "Obesity in pakistan", "Obesity in hindi", "Obesity in urdu", "Obesity lecture in urdu", "Obesity meaning in urdu", "Obesity homeopathic medicine", "Obesity pronunciation", "Obesity treatment", "Obesity"], "comments": 184, "likes": "3156", "channel_name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "channel_subscribers": "276000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 338.0, "keyword": "OBESITY", "rank": 24, "consine similarity": 0.0}

Chapters   0:00 Introduction  1:15 Causes of Sleep Apnea  2:00 Symptoms of Sleep Apnea  2:23 Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea  3:39 Treatment of Sleep Apnea     Sleep apnea, also spelled sleep apnoea, is a sleep disorder in which pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep occur more often than normal.[1] Each pause can last for a few seconds to a few minutes and they happen many times a night.[1] In the most common form, this follows loud snoring.[2] There may be a choking or snorting sound as breathing resumes.[1] Because the disorder disrupts normal sleep, those affected may experience sleepiness or feel tired during the day.[1] In children, it may cause hyperactivity or problems in school.[2]  Sleep apnea may be either obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in which breathing is interrupted by a blockage of air flow, central sleep apnea (CSA), in which regular unconscious breath simply stops, or a combination of the two.[1] OSA is the most common form.[1] OSA has four key contributors; these include \u201canatomical compromises\" like a narrow, crowded, or collapsible upper airway. Or \u201cnon-anatomical\u201d ones like an ineffective pharyngeal dilator muscle function during sleep, airway narrowing during sleep, or unstable control of breathing (high loop gain).[11] Other risk factors include being overweight, a family history of the condition, allergies, and enlarged tonsils.[7] Some people with sleep apnea are unaware they have the condition.[1] In many cases it is first observed by a family member.[1] Sleep apnea is often diagnosed with an overnight sleep study.[8] For a diagnosis of sleep apnea, more than five episodes per hour must occur.[12]", "tags": ["sleep apnea", "sleep apnea machine", "sleep apnea beach fossils", "sleep apnea treatment", "sleep apnea exercises", "sleep apnea snoring", "sleep apnea chevelle", "sleep apnea symptoms", "sleep apnea test", "sleep apnea mouthpiece", "sleep apnea sounds", "sleep apnea snoring sound", "sleep apnea va claim", "sleep apnea surgery vs cpap"], "comments": 71, "likes": "1258", "channel_name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "channel_subscribers": "276000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 288.0, "keyword": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome", "rank": 22, "consine similarity": 0.08304547985373997}

Normally when you breathe in, air flows in through your mouth and nose and down your throat, also called the pharynx. Air then slows down your windpipe, or trachea, spreading through a tree-like structure of smaller tubes into your lungs.   Each time you breathe in, negative suction pressure pulls the soft tissues in your mouth and pharynx inward. The muscles in your pharynx respond by pulling the soft tissues outward again, which keeps your airway open.   When you sleep, it's normal for the muscles in your mouth, tongue, and pharynx to relax slightly, but not enough to block your airway. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles of your mouth and pharynx may relax too much. Your tongue drops onto the soft tissue in the roof of your mouth, pressing it against the back of your throat. This completely blocks the flow of air into your lungs. The lack of oxygen in your lungs wakes you up. You may gasp for air to reestablish air flow before falling asleep again.   The cycle of apnea and waking up may happen many times at night, preventing restful sleep. Factors that may contribute to obstructive sleep apnea include obesity, because more fat may be present in the walls of the pharynx, a small or receding jaw with a narrowed airway, loss of muscle tone in your pharynx due to aging, and swollen tonsils.   Common symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea are snoring, morning headaches, chronic daytime sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, and impaired concentration. Left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea may lead to complications, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, irregular heart beats, called arrhythmias, stroke, and diabetes.   Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to treat obstructive sleep apnea, including losing weight, sleeping on your side, not smoking, and avoiding substances that can make you sleepy, such as alcohol and sedatives.   For mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea, an oral appliance may keep your airway open. This device works by pulling your jaw forward and moving both your tongue and the roof of your mouth away from the back of your throat.   The most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is a continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP machine. This machine pumps air through a tube into a mask that fits over your nose or both your nose and mouth. The mild air pressure of the CPAP machine helps keep your airway open, enabling you to get a deep, restful sleep.  #SleepApnea #Snoring #CPAP", "tags": ["3D", "medical", "animation", "patient education", "video", "health literacy", "obstructive sleep apnea", "breathing", "sleep", "pharynx", "pharyngeal", "throat", "lungs", "uvula", "palate", "oral", "dental appliance", "CPAP", "air", "oxygen", "device", "health", "nucleus medical media", "Sleep Apnea (Disease Or Medical Condition)", "respiratory", "sleeping", "Bed"], "comments": 1469, "likes": "32296", "channel_name": "Nucleus Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UC85VW73bQLEjs_taFKP7TwQ", "channel_subscribers": "6130000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 259.0, "keyword": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome", "rank": 6, "consine similarity": 0.0}

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a PROGRESSIVE inflammatory lung disease characterized by INCREASING breathing difficulty. Other symptoms include cough, most commonly with mucus, chest tightness and wheezing. COPD develops as a result of LONG-TERM exposure to irritants such as smoke, chemical fumes or dusts, and may go UNNOTICED for years. Most people show symptoms after the age of 40 when the disease is already in its advanced stage. The lungs consist of millions of air tubes or airways, called bronchi and bronchioles, which bring air in and out of the body. These airways end with tiny air sacs - the alveoli - where the gas exchange process takes place. REPEATED inhalation of irritants results in a CHRONIC inflammatory response which brings in a large amount of defensive cells along with inflammatory chemicals from the immune system. Inflammation of the airways causes them to thicken and produce mucus, NARROWING the air passage \u2013 this is known as CHRONIC BRONCHITIS. Inflammatory chemicals also dissolve alveolar walls, resulting in DESTRUCTION of the air sacs \u2013 this is EMPHYSEMA. COPD is, basically, a COMBINATION of these two conditions. Tobacco smoking is accountable for about 90% of COPD cases. These include current, former smokers and people frequently exposed to second-hand smoke.    Extended contact with harmful chemicals such as fumes from burning fuel or dusts, at home or workplace, may also cause COPD. Genetics has been implicated in a small number of cases. Notably, a condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AAT deficiency, has been shown to increase risks for COPD and other lung diseases. AAT protein protects the lungs from damaging effects of enzymes released during inflammation. Low levels of AAT make lung tissues more vulnerable to destruction when inflamed. While people with AAT deficiency may develop COPD even WITHOUT smoking or exposure to harmful irritants, AAT deficient smokers are at MUCH greater risks. COPD is diagnosed based on symptoms, history of exposure to irritants and lung function tests. The major test for COPD is SPIROMETRY, in which the patient is asked to blow into a tube connected to a machine \u2013 a spirometer. Spirometry evaluates pulmonary functions by measuring the volume and the speed of air flow during inhalation and exhalation.  There is no cure for COPD but treatments can relieve symptoms, prevent complications and slow down progression of the disease. The first and most essential step to treatment is to stop smoking and/or improve air quality at home and workplace. These are also the most effective measures in preventing the disease.  Other treatments include: -Medication: bronchodilators are used to widen the airways; steroids to relieve inflammation. -Vaccination against flu and pneumococcal pneumonia: this is to prevent serious complications COPD patients may have with these respiratory infections. -Supplemental oxygen: this can improve quality of life provided that the patient no longer smokes. -Breathing exercises and other therapies as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program. -Finally, surgery may be performed for severe cases when other methods fail. Surgical procedures include bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, where damaged parts of the lung are removed; and lung transplant, where the entire diseased lung is replaced with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "AAT deficiency", "alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency", "alveoli", "anatomy", "animated", "animation", "breathing difficulty", "bronchi", "bronchioles", "causes", "chronic bronchitis", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "conditions", "COPD", "diagnosis", "diseases", "emphysema", "gene", "genetics", "inflammation", "lung", "lung function test", "mechanism", "medical", "medicine", "pathology", "problems", "public health", "pulmonary", "pulmonology", "respiration", "respiratory", "risk factors", "smoke", "smoker", "smoking", "spirometry", "symptoms", "treatments"], "comments": 48, "likes": "2710", "channel_name": "Alila Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A", "channel_subscribers": "997000", "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 258.0, "keyword": "Obstructive Syndrome", "rank": 6, "consine similarity": 0.0}

The condition is defined and some of its causes are listed. This lesson goes into detail about CPR in these situations, and the ACLS manual Figure 21 provides further information about the ACLS Survey.  \"Respiratory arrest is an emergent condition in which the individual is either not breathing or is breathing ineffectively. Individuals in respiratory arrest require immediate attention.   There are many causes of respiratory arrest, including but not limited to cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock. Resuscitate individuals in apparent respiratory arrest using either the BLS or the ACLS Survey.  The BLS Survey advises to check for responsiveness, call EMS and get AED, check for responsiveness again, and defibrillate. Figure 20 in your corresponding ACLS manual details the BLS survey.   The ACLS Survey follows the ABCD pattern, in which you check for Airway, Breathing, Circulation, and  Differential Diagnosis. Refer to Figure 21 in your corresponding ACLS manual to further learn about the ACLS Survey.  When caring for individuals in respiratory arrest, keep in mind the two types of ventilation: advanced and basic. Advanced ventilation includes an esophageal-tracheal tube, endotracheal tube, laryngeal tube, and laryngeal mask airway. Basic ventilation includes mouth-to-mouth or nose, bag-mask ventilation, oropharyngeal airway, and nasopharyngeal airway.   Although OPAs and NPAs are considered to be basic airways, they require proper placement by an experienced provider. Advanced airway insertion requires specialized training beyond the scope of ACLS certification. While the placement of advanced airways requires specialized training, all ACLS providers should know the proper use of advanced airways once they are placed. Regardless of airway type, proper airway management is an important part of ACLS.   CPR is performed with the individual lying on their back; gravity causes the jaw, the tongue, and the tissues of the throat to fall back and obstruct the airway. The airway rarely remains open in an unconscious individual without any external support. Therefore, you have to open the airway by lifting the chin upward while tilting the forehead back. This is known as the head-tilt-chin-lift maneuver. The goal is to create a straighter path from the nose to the trachea.  In individuals with a suspected neck injury, protect the cervical spine by performing the jaw-thrust maneuver to open the airway. While standard practice in a suspected neck injury is to place a cervical collar, this should not be done in BLS or ACLS. Cervical collars can compress the airway and interfere with resuscitation efforts. As a provider, you must ensure an open airway regardless of the basic airway used. It is your responsibility to stabilize the head or ask for assistance while maintaining control of the airway.  During respiratory arrest care, be sure not to over ventilate, that is given too many breaths per minute or too large volume per breath. Both can increase intrathoracic pressure, decrease venous return to the heart, diminished cardiac output, as well as predispose individuals to vomit and aspiration of gastrointestinal contents.\"   Need certified or rectified in ACLS, visit https://disquefoundation.org/acls-course-certification-renewal/ ************************************** Follow us on social media!

Your brain senses this inability to breathe and briefly awakens you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway.    This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it.  You may make a snorting, gasping or choking sound.    This may happen a few times a night, or in more severe cases, several hundred times a night.  People with OSA may not be aware that their sleep was ever interrupted.  If you think you may have this form of sleep apnea, contact a physician.
