But getting quality sleep isn't always easy.   Many factors contribute to a good night's sleep. While your environment, eating habits, exercise routine, and mental health all contribute to your sleep quality, the way we breathe is definitely something that we shouldn't overlook.  Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that affects our ability to breathe during the night. Around 22 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea. It is prevalent in all ages, from kids and teenagers to adults. With this condition, breathing is interrupted while sleeping through repetitive pauses, referred to as apneic events.   Despite its commonality, sleep apnea is still not well-understood. Many don't even realize that there are different types of sleep apnea, and the importance of understanding the difference when it comes to treatment. The two most prominent types include obstructive sleep apnea (most common) and central sleep apnea.  Keep reading to learn more about the difference between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea, the symptoms, causes, risk factors, and treatment options.

Blood pressure is the force the circulating blood EXERTS on the walls of blood vessels. It is different in different types of vessels, but the term \u201dblood pressure\u201d, when not specified otherwise, refers to ARTERIAL pressure in the SYSTEMIC circulation.  When the heart contracts and pumps blood into the aorta, during systole, the aortic pressure RISES, and so does the systemic arterial pressure. The maximum pressure following an ejection is called the SYSTOLIC pressure. In between heart beats, when the ventricles refill, blood pressure FALLS to its lowest value called the DIASTOLIC pressure. THESE are the 2 numbers on a blood pressure reading.   Blood pressure normally shows a daily pattern and is usually lower at night. During day-time, it fluctuates with physical activities and emotional states.  Hypertension refers to a PERSISTENT HIGH blood pressure. In the US, high blood pressure used to be defined as greater than 140/90, but recent guidelines have changed these values to 130/80 to better prevent and treat the condition. Normal blood pressure is BELOW 120/80. In practice, blood pressure is considered TOO low ONLY if it produces symptoms. Hypertension does NOT cause symptoms on its own, but it slowly DAMAGES blood vessels, and in the long-term, is a MAJOR risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, aneurysm and heart attack; as well as end organ damage such as renal failure or vision loss. For this reason, hypertension is known as the \u201cSILENT killer\u201d.   Hypertension can be classified as primary or secondary, with the former being responsible for over 90% of cases. Primary hypertension has NO apparent cause and may develop as a result of old age, obesity, high-salt diet, lack of exercise, smoking and drinking. Most commonly, the blood vessels are hardened with age or unhealthy diets, making it harder for blood to flow. Secondary hypertension, on the other hand, is caused by an underlying condition. Many conditions and factors can cause hypertension; most notable are kidney problems and endocrine disturbances.   Regardless of the cause, the INcrease in blood pressure is produced by EITHER an INcrease in vascular resistance - narrower or stiffer blood vessels; OR an INcrease in cardiac output \u2013 larger volume of blood pumped out by the heart. These 2 factors are the targets of antihypertensive drugs. Treatments must start with life style changes such as healthy, low-sodium diets, physical exercise and stress management.  On top of that, antihypertensive agents may be used to control hypertension. These include:  - Vasodilators: these drugs DILATE blood vessels, thereby DEcreasing vascular resistance and reducing blood pressure. - Diuretics: diuretics promote sodium and water removal by the kidneys and thereby DEcrease blood volume.  - Drugs that DEcrease cardiac output by decreasing heart rate or contractility, may also be used to treat hypertension.", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "anatomy", "animated", "antihypertensive agents", "arterial stiffness", "atherosclerosis", "blood pressure", "cardiac output", "cardiology", "cardiovascular", "cholesterol", "circulation", "circulatory system", "complications", "conditions", "diastolic blood pressure", "diseases", "drugs", "essential hypertension", "etiology", "high blood pressure", "hypertension", "hypertensive", "medical", "medicine", "pathology", "physiopathology", "primary hypertension", "secondary hypertension", "systolic blood pressure", "vascular resistance"], "comments": 157, "likes": "10600", "channel": {"name": "Alila Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A", "subscribers": "965000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 229.0, "keyword": "Elevated blood pressure", "rank": 1, "consine similarity": 0.07014306238318944}

Transcript:  The concern with testosterone replacement and red blood cells or some patients may have heard of the H&H, which is the hematocrit and hemoglobin. A lot of guys when you give testosterone to your body, your body can make more red blood cells. Red blood cells are the cells that carry oxygen in your blood. So, in general, that's not a bad thing. Many endurance athletes train at high altitudes for that same effect. They'll go to Denver and train so that their body senses lower oxygen levels and produces more red blood cells so that they have more aerobic capacity. Many endurance athletes are looking for that effect. The caveat to that is if there are too many red blood cells, which we do monitor that with each set of labs, we monitor that closely. If it gets to a certain point where there are too many red blood cells, we do have a little bit of concern. The reason we have some concern is, if you think about it, there are more cells in the blood, so the blood's a little bit more viscous, a little thicker. So several things we do to address that. Initially, preventatively, we always have every one of our patients, whether you're on testosterone or not, we have you do a fish oil supplement. There are many benefits to fish oil. One of them is it's a natural blood thinner; it helps to combat any thickening effect that might occur. On the back end, if we do discover that your levels are getting to a point where we start to get concerned, a very simple remedy to it is we recommend our patients\u2019 blood if they're able to donate blood. That's a win-win situation. You get your counts down, and you do a good deed, you help someone else. If you're not able to donate blood for various reasons, you've had a recent tattoo or infectious disease or any of those reasons; we give you a prescription for what we call therapeutic phlebotomy. Which is donating blood but they discard it, they don't give it to someone else.", "tags": ["trt", "hrt", "hormone", "hormones", "sideeffects", "rbc", "redbloodcells", "hematocrit", "TRT side effect", "high red blood cells", "testosterone hematocrit", "high hematocrit", "Dr Saya", "defy medical", "TRT clinic", "low T", "testosterone side effects", "therapeutic phlebotomy"], "comments": 2, "likes": "467", "channel": {"name": "Defy Medical", "chanenelID": "UC7OSzkE__kOeBWlHHIrcbvQ", "subscribers": "2730"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 115.0, "keyword": "Elevated hematocrit", "rank": 5, "consine similarity": 0.05976143046671968}

It can have many possible causes such as seasonal affective disorder[1] and can cause distress and problems with functioning.[2] In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), hypersomnolence, of which there are several subtypes, appears under sleep-wake disorders.[3]  Hypersomnia is a pathological state characterized by a lack of alertness during the waking episodes of the day.[4] It is not to be confused with fatigue, which is a normal physiological state.[5] Daytime sleepiness appears most commonly during situations where little interaction is needed.[6]  Since the patients\u2019 attention levels are impaired, their quality of life may be impacted as well.[7] This is especially true for people whose jobs request high levels of attention, for example in the healthcare field.[7] Indeed, the lack of attention can cause injuries to self or others, which makes this disorder a real public health issue.[7]", "tags": ["hypersomnia", "hypersomnia treatment", "hypersomnia sleep disorder", "hypersomnia depression", "hypersomnia hypnosis", "hypersomnia longboard", "hypersomnia vs narcolepsy", "hypersomnia movie", "hypersomnia treatment in hindi"], "comments": 76, "likes": "1026", "channel": {"name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "subscribers": "258000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 232.0, "keyword": "Epworth Sleepiness Scale", "rank": 15, "consine similarity": 0.0}

You will hear the types of noises often made by the person experiencing laryngospasm, and see what the vocal cords are doing at the same time. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 Educational Website: https://laryngopedia.com/  Business Website: https://www.bastianvoice.com/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/bastianvoicedoc/  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/laryngopedia/                    https://www.facebook.com/BastianVoiceInstitute/  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bastian-voice-institute  Figure1: https://app.figure1.com/profile/", "tags": ["health", "laryngospasm", "Bastian", "Voice", "Institute", "Dr", "robert", "difficulty", "breathing", "problem", "downers", "grove", "illinois", "Bastian Medical Media for Laryngology", "Joan Rivers (Musical Artist)", "attack"], "comments": 1002, "likes": "3241", "channel": {"name": "Laryngopedia", "chanenelID": "UCOFcq1mWBXQt6JtO0HBn4jA", "subscribers": "106000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 296.0, "keyword": "Gasping for air during sleep", "rank": 9, "consine similarity": 0.0}

This condition can lead to hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder, right-sided heart failure, as well as their cognitive ability to learn. Stephen Early, MD, discusses the causes, symptoms and treatments of obstructive sleep apnea in children.  Learn more at https://childrens.uvahealth.com/services/pediatric-sleep  Obstructive sleep apnea is an entity where children stop breathing when they sleep. They\u2019ll have periods of obstruction, not just mild snoring, but snoring, stopping breathing, and then gasping.   Their sleep may become motion-filled where they flop around, seeking a position where they\u2019re not obstructing.   Obstructive sleep apnea in children can lead to hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder. At its worst extreme, it can even lead to right-sided heart failure. Children retain fluid.   It\u2019s also been shown to impact how they learn. There are neurocognitive impacts of having obstructive sleep apnea. If you don't sleep well at night, you don't have your brain refreshed.   When they come to see me, the clinical history may be so compelling that we don't need to do a sleep study and, consequently, we\u2019ll go ahead and fix what the problem is with the child.   Many times we\u2019ll send the child for a sleep study, where they\u2019ll spend the night in a lab and learn how much obstruction they have: whether or not they have heart arrhythmias or any other things like that.   A tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy often cures for sleep apnea in children.   We typically will see the child back after surgical intervention to make sure that everything is resolved and it\u2019s very effective for most of the children.", "tags": ["obstructive sleep apnea in children", "sleep apnea symptoms in kids", "osa in children", "obstructive sleep apnea toddler", "pediatric sleep apnea treatment", "obstructive sleep apnea in kids", "childhood sleep apnea symptoms", "sleep apnea in young child", "severe sleep apnea in toddlers", "sleep apnea doctors near me", "sleep apnea clinic near me", "sleep apnea specialist", "charlottesville", "uva", "university of virginia", "sleep apnea center near me", "best sleep study centers near me"], "comments": 0, "likes": "17", "channel": {"name": "uvahealth", "chanenelID": "UCAUMuw4KF1mPdOlxaAbTDmw", "subscribers": "10100"}, "accreditationTag": 1, "duration": 84.0, "keyword": "Gasping for air during sleep", "rank": 3, "consine similarity": 0.1091089451179962}

Psychiatry \u2013 Sleep Disorders Whiteboard Animation Transcript with Elliott Lee, MD https://medskl.com/Course/Detail/psychiatry  Sleep problems can be divided into complaints that people have:  1. One of the most common complaints is excessive daytime sleepiness. There are generally 5 major causes for excessive daytime sleepiness\u2026  \u2026the most common of which is an insufficient quantity of sleep. Many medical students suffer from this!  Next is a poor quality of sleep. Environmental disturbances (such as light, partner, pet), or other intrinsic sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder could be involved.   Thirdly, and less common, is a pathologic disorder of sleepiness during the day, including narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.   Fourthly, a medical or psychiatric disorder, such as a thyroid condition, cancer, medication side effect, or mood disorder can present with sleepiness.  Finally, a circadian rhythm disorder such as shift work, or jet lag could also be a culprit.  2. On the other hand, sometimes patients complain of difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, or \u201cinsomnia\u201d. This symptom can be a primary disorder on its own, but is usually the result of, or exacerbated by one or a combination of four factors:   An acute stressor. This is a common culprit in many cases of insomnia, but often is comorbid with other factors   Circadian rhythm issue \u2013 including shift work or a circadian rhythm disorder   A medical or neurologic condition \u2013 common culprits include medications or substances such as caffeine, alcohol, a thyroid problem, or other potential medical disorders, and   A psychiatric condition, especially mood or anxiety disorders.  3. Lastly, another presentation could be an unusual behavior at night. This is referred to as a parasomnia, or disorder of arousal. These are often classified according to what stage of sleep they emerge from:  NREM sleep parasomnias typically include sleepwalking, or night terrors,   While the classic REM parasomnia is REM behavior disorder, where patients act out their dreams.", "tags": ["medskl.com", "FOAMEd", "clinical", "animation", "medical", "school", "CME"], "comments": 0, "likes": "997", "channel": {"name": "Medskl.com", "chanenelID": "UC54htze_JB0zz9H6oAbMOJQ", "subscribers": "79100"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 154.0, "keyword": "Intrinsic Sleep Disorders", "rank": 2, "consine similarity": 0.08535791995526398}

Chapters  0:00 Introduction 1:13 Causes of Myotonic dystrophy 2:37 Symptoms of Myotonic dystrophy 3:42 Diagnosis of Myotonic dystrophy 4:14 Treatment of Myotonic dystrophy        Myotonic dystrophy is a type of muscular dystrophy, a group of long-term genetic disorders that impair muscle function.[1] Symptoms include gradually worsening muscle loss and weakness.[1] Muscles often contract and are unable to relax.[1] Other symptoms may include cataracts, intellectual disability and heart conduction problems.[1][2] In men, there may be early balding and an inability to have children.[1]  Myotonic dystrophy is typically inherited from a person's parents, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.[1] There are two main types: type 1 (DM1), due to mutations in the DMPK gene, and type 2 (DM2), due to mutations in the CNBP gene.[1] The disorder generally worsens in each generation.[1] A type of DM1 may be apparent at birth.[1] DM2 is generally milder.[1] Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing.[2]  There is no cure.[3] Treatments may include braces or wheelchairs, pacemakers and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.[2] The medications mexiletine or carbamazepine are occasionally helpful.[2] Pain, if it occurs, may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).[2]  Myotonic dystrophy affects more than 1 in 8,000 people worldwide.[1] While myotonic dystrophy can occur at any age, onset is typically in the 20s and 30s.[1] It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood.[1] It was first described in 1909, with the underlying cause of type 1 determined in 1992.[2]", "tags": ["myotonic muscular dystrophy type 1", "myotonic muscular dystrophy type 2", "myotonic dystrophy gait", "myotonic dystrophy diagnosis", "myotonic dystrophy neet", "myotonic dystrophy paces", "myotonic dystrophy mnemonic", "myotonic dystrophy emg", "myotonic dystrophy symptoms", "myotonic dystrophy exercise", "myotonic dystrophy type 2", "myotonic dystrophy patient", "myotonic dystrophy pedigree analysis", "myotonic dystrophy"], "comments": 18, "likes": "192", "channel": {"name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "subscribers": "258000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 284.0, "keyword": "MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY", "rank": 3, "consine similarity": 0.0}

It began almost by accident in 2009 when Dr. Childers was introduced to the mother of a child with a rare disease called Myotubular Myopathy. The mother asked Dr. Childers about finding a dog that might have the disease. He agreed and she was able to find a dog with a rare mutation responsible for this disease in canines. French collaborators provided gene replacement medicine that allowed the testing in dogs with the disease. They discovered that after a few weeks, dogs destined to die due to muscle and respiratory weakness completely recovered. It was a watershed moment in gene therapy. Through a partnership with a bio-tech company and the NIH, Dr. Childers and his team have been able to replicate this finding in a larger number of animals and find a dose that is effective and potentially curative. The hope is to use this research to help patients with Myotubular Myopathy and it could begin in 2016.

Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis, and depression.  Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Food intake and energy expenditure must be balanced to maintain a healthy body weight. This balance is kept by the central nervous system, which controls feeding behavior and energy metabolism.  Several brain systems are involved, including the brainstem which receives neuronal inputs from the digestive tract, and the hypothalamus which picks up hormonal and nutritional signals from the circulation. They also interact with the reward and motivation pathways, which drive food-seeking behavior. The arcuate nucleus, ARC, of the hypothalamus: two groups of neurons, with opposing functions, in the ARC: the appetite-stimulating neurons expressing NPY and AGRP peptides, and the appetite-suppressing neurons producing POMC peptide. Neurons of the ARC project to other nuclei of the hypothalamus, of which the paraventricular nucleus, PVN, is most important. PVN neurons further process the information and project to other circuits outside the hypothalamus, thus coordinating a response that controls energy intake and expenditure.  Short-term regulation of feeding is based on how empty or how full the stomach is, and if there are nutrients in the intestine. In the fasting state, an empty stomach sends stretch information to the brainstem, signaling hunger. It produces a peptide called ghrelin, which acts on the arcuate nucleus to stimulate feeding. Ghrelin also acts directly on the PVN to reduce energy expenditure.  Upon food ingestion, distension of the stomach is perceived by the brainstem as satiety. Several other gut peptides are released from the intestine and act on the hypothalamus and other brain areas to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure.  Long-term regulation takes cues from the amount of body fat: low body fat content encourages feeding and energy preservation, while high body fat suppresses appetite and promotes energy expenditure. Two hormones are involved: leptin and insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and is released into the bloodstream upon food ingestion, when blood glucose starts to rise. Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissues in a process dependent on insulin. The amount of circulating leptin in the plasma is directly proportional to the body fat content. Increased leptin levels in the blood signal to the brain that the body has enough energy storage, and that it has to stop eating and burn more energy. Leptin and insulin seem to work together on hypothalamic nuclei, as well as other brain areas, to inhibit food intake and increase energy expenditure. Obesity results from the dysregulation of feeding behaviors and energy metabolism. Obesity is associated with chronic low leptin activities, which trick the brain into thinking that the body is always starved. This leads to overeating and excessive energy storage as fats.  The major lifestyle factor is a high-fat, energy-rich diet. In an early stage of high-fat-diet\u2013induced obesity, increased amounts of saturated fatty acids cross the blood brain barrier and provoke an inflammatory response in hypothalamic neurons. Inflammation induces stress in these neurons, blunting their response to leptin. This is known as leptin resistance. Leptin levels are high, but because the cells cannot react to leptin, the brain interprets it as low and triggers the starvation response. Genetic factors include mutations in the leptin gene itself, or in one of the numerous downstream genes that are required for leptin action in various pathways. Leptin deficiency due to gene mutations is very rare. More common are mutations in the downstream genes, which render a certain pathway irresponsive to leptin.  A major risk factor for childhood obesity is maternal obesity and mother\u2019s high-fat-diet during pregnancy and lactation. A maternal diet rich in saturated fats can cause inflammation in the infant\u2019s hypothalamus.

{"id": "5x9g8xrwzrU", "title": "7a: Respiratory Arrest (2022)", "views": "3546", "date_published": "2022-07-18", "description": "Chapter 7 discusses respiratory arrest. The condition is defined and some of its causes are listed. This lesson goes into detail about CPR in these situations, and the ACLS manual Figure 21 provides further information about the ACLS Survey.  \"Respiratory arrest is an emergent condition in which the individual is either not breathing or is breathing ineffectively. Individuals in respiratory arrest require immediate attention.   There are many causes of respiratory arrest, including but not limited to cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock. Resuscitate individuals in apparent respiratory arrest using either the BLS or the ACLS Survey.  The BLS Survey advises to check for responsiveness, call EMS and get AED, check for responsiveness again, and defibrillate. Figure 20 in your corresponding ACLS manual details the BLS survey.   The ACLS Survey follows the ABCD pattern, in which you check for Airway, Breathing, Circulation, and  Differential Diagnosis. Refer to Figure 21 in your corresponding ACLS manual to further learning about the ACLS Survey.  When caring for individuals in respiratory arrest, keep in mind the two types of ventilation: advanced and basic. Advanced ventilation includes an esophageal-tracheal tube, endotracheal tube, laryngeal tube, and laryngeal mask airway. Basic ventilation includes mouth-to-mouth or nose, bag-mask ventilation, oropharyngeal airway, and nasopharyngeal airway.   Although OPAs and NPAs are considered to be basic airways, they require proper placement by an experienced provider. Advanced airway insertion requires specialized training beyond the scope of ACLS certification. While the placement of advanced airways requires specialized training, all ACLS providers should know the proper use of advanced airways once they are placed. Regardless of airway type, proper airway management is an important part of ACLS.   CPR is performed with the individual lying on their back; gravity causes the jaw, the tongue, and the tissues of the throat to fall back and obstruct the airway. The airway rarely remains open in an unconscious individual without any external support. Therefore, you have to open the airway by lifting the chin upward while tilting the forehead back. This is known as the head-tilt-chin-lift maneuver. The goal is to create a straighter path from the nose to the trachea.  In individuals with a suspected neck injury, protect the cervical spine by performing the jaw-thrust maneuver to open the airway. While standard practice in a suspected neck injury is to place a cervical collar, this should not be done in BLS or ACLS. Cervical collars can compress the airway and interfere with resuscitation efforts. As a provider, you must ensure an open airway regardless of the basic airway used. It is your responsibility to stabilize the head or ask for assistance while maintaining control of the airway.  During respiratory arrest care, be sure not to over ventilate ACLS management of VF and VT are essentially the same. Resuscitation for VF and pulseless VT starts with the BLS Survey, that is given too many breaths per minute or too large volume per breath. Both can increase intrathoracic pressure, decrease venous return to the heart, diminished cardiac output, as well as predispose individuals to vomit and aspiration of gastrointestinal contents.\"  Need to be certified or recertified in ACLS, visit https://disquefoundation.org/acls-course-certification-renewal/ ************************************** Follow us on social media!

The most common form is Obstructive Sleep Apnea.    OSA occurs when the soft tissue in the back of the throat relaxes causing your airway to narrow.    When your airway repeatedly becomes blocked it limits the amount of air that reaches your lungs.    Your brain senses this inability to breathe and briefly awakens you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway.    This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it.  You may make a snorting, gasping or choking sound.    This may happen a few times a night, or in more severe cases, several hundred times a night.  People with OSA may not be aware that their sleep was ever interrupted.  If you think you may have this form of sleep apnea, contact a physician.  Sleep apnea is treated with lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) breathing devices and in extreme situations surgery may be required.", "tags": ["CPAP", "Breathing devices", "sleep apena", "breathing", "blocked airways", "Obstructive airways", "Sleep disorder"], "comments": 0, "likes": "234", "channel": {"name": "Elara Systems", "chanenelID": "UCmdRz1dx9emtqLr4wBkq6Nw", "subscribers": "39700"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 77.0, "keyword": "Sleep Apnea", "rank": 11, "consine similarity": 0.15249857033260467}

Or \u201cnon-anatomical\u201d ones like an ineffective pharyngeal dilator muscle function during sleep, airway narrowing during sleep, or unstable control of breathing (high loop gain).[11] Other risk factors include being overweight, a family history of the condition, allergies, and enlarged tonsils.[7] Some people with sleep apnea are unaware they have the condition.[1] In many cases it is first observed by a family member.[1] Sleep apnea is often diagnosed with an overnight sleep study.[8] For a diagnosis of sleep apnea, more than five episodes per hour must occur.[12]", "tags": ["sleep apnea", "sleep apnea machine", "sleep apnea beach fossils", "sleep apnea treatment", "sleep apnea exercises", "sleep apnea snoring", "sleep apnea chevelle", "sleep apnea symptoms", "sleep apnea test", "sleep apnea mouthpiece", "sleep apnea sounds", "sleep apnea snoring sound", "sleep apnea va claim", "sleep apnea surgery vs cpap"], "comments": 66, "likes": "1092", "channel": {"name": "Medical Centric", "chanenelID": "UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw", "subscribers": "258000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 288.0, "keyword": "Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome", "rank": 17, "consine similarity": 0.08304547985373997}

Pateron, R. Marianowski, P.-J. Monteyrol, V. Couloigner, M. Akkari, F. Chalumeau, P. Fayoux, N. Leboulanger, P. Franco, M. Mondain\r ObjectiveThe authors present the guidelines of the French Society of ENT and Head & Neck Surgery (SFORL) on the role of the ENT physician in childhood obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). This section of the guidelines concerns the roles of the various medical and surgical treatment options.MethodA multidisciplinary work-group was entrusted with a review of the scientific literature on the topic. Based on the retrieved articles and the group members\u2019 own experience, guidelines were drawn up, then read over by a reading group independent of the work-group. An editorial meeting then produced the final text.ResultsAdenotonsillectomy is the reference treatment for childhood OSAHS with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Respiratory assistance is recommended in children with severe OSAHS without nasal and/or oropharyngeal obstacle, after surgery in case of persistent OSAHS, in case of contraindications to surgery, in complex obstruction related to pharyngolaryngeal or laryngeal pathology or comorbidity, or as an alternative to tracheotomy. Nasal route corticosteroids may be used in childhood OSAHS in with associated nasal obstruction.\r \r Add tags (Currently: ORL, Medicine by Alexandros G.

There are many people who have an irregular body clock and they just don\u2019t know it.  Circadian rhythm sleep disorders occur when there is a mismatch between the sleep-wake cycle required by your environment and your own internal sleep wake cycle.  There are 5 main types of circadian rhythm disorders.  They are delayed phase sleep disorder, advanced phase sleep disorder, Non-24 hour sleep wake disorder, shift work and jet lag.   Delayed phase sleep disorder occurs when you can\u2019t seem to get sleepy until very late in the evening \u2013 typically between 1am and 6am.  This is despite your best efforts to settle down and get to bed hours earlier.   And because you feel asleep late, you are are naturally driven to sleep until late morning or early afternoon.  Sleeping late becomes a problem when you have an inflexible morning schedule.  Let\u2019s say you have to wake up at 6am to go to work so you can\u2019t afford to be awake at 2am.  For those who have flexible schedules, they can simply sleep later and end up getting a full 7-9 hours of sleep.    There is an adolescent version of this that is usually hormonally driven and seen in about 10% of teenagers.  It\u2019s tough when they are trying to get up to go to school, but they often grow out of it by early 20\u2019s.  People with advanced phase sleep disorder have the opposite problem. They have trouble keeping her eyes open early in the evening and want to go to sleep between 6 and 8pm. This tends to be less disruptive a problem for the person who has a 9-to-5 job. But here is where it can cause problems:   you get home from work and fall asleep on the couch at 7pm and wake up at 11pm.  You then can\u2019t go back to sleep until 2 AM and sleep until 5am. Cumulatively you\u2019ve gotten seven hours of sleep. But you still don\u2019t feel rested because your sleep is choppy and your natural progression and flow of your sleep cycle was interrupted.    Then we have the non-24-hour sleep wake disorder.  For this person, their body clock is longer than 24 hrs, lets just say 25hr.  So what happens is they naturally go to sleep later and later each night.  Eventually they have complete day-night reversal.  This sleep disorder is more commonly seen in people who are blind, but does occur is sighted people as well.  It tends to be very debilitating as the person has no reliable or consistent sleep pattern.  I will talk about solutions to these problems in a later videos.  I will talk about shift work and jet lag in the lifestyle interference video, but just know that they are classified as circadian rhythm disorders.

Doghramji, MD, FAAFP  The educational design of this activity addresses the needs of primary care providers (PCPs), sleep specialists, and other clinicians involved in the identification and ongoing treatment of patients with non\u201324-hour sleep-wake disorder (non-24 disorder). Non-24 disorder is an intrinsic circadian rhythm disorder characterized by cyclic desynchronization between the patient\u2019s endogenous physiologic rhythms and the earth\u2019s 24-hour light/dark cycle. Although most affected individuals are totally blind and completely lack the daily entrainment signal provided by light, recent research has suggested that the disorder is more common than previously appreciated in partially blind patients, and\u2014albeit still rare\u2014in sighted teenagers and young adults. Delays or even complete failures in the diagnosis of non-24 disorder are all too common, in part because patients do not proactively discuss sleep problems with their clinicians. Time-constrained providers also may not specifically probe for the presence of the cardinal symptoms of excessive sleepiness and insomnia, even in high-risk cohorts. Clinicians are further challenged to individualize evidence-based treatment regimens, especially because the recently updated national practice parameters on managing intrinsic circadian rhythm disorders do not fully integrate the only agent that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of non-24 disorder. This online Point-of-Care 101 (POC101) program has been built around a 3D animation and lively discussions between 2 sleep medicine experts on the pathophysiologic basis of non-24 disorder, actionable diagnostic recommendations, nonpharmacologic treatment approaches, and the latest evidence for pharmacologic modalities.

{"id": "Nrt_amb8_y0", "title": "HOW STRESS AFFECTS YOUR HEALTH", "views": "21288", "date_published": "2018-08-13", "description": "Stress is a threat, real or perceived, to homeostasis \u2013 the body\u2019s normal functional equilibrium. This pervasive phenomenon elicits a physiological response, which, if disproportionate, either in magnitude or duration sustained, can be detrimental to the body. The body has mechanisms in place to repair the resulting damage once the stressor has passed, but chronic stress disrupts these mechanisms. As we age, the delicate balance between damage and restoration progressively tips, and impairments accumulate. Prolonged stress can affect how quickly we age and when we begin to show signs of pathology. Nearly two thirds of diseases are thought to be triggered by stress, and daily stress can increase an individual\u2019s risk for developing non-communicable diseases, or NCDs. An NCD is a disease that is not infectious and not communicable, as it is not caused by an infectious agent. Examples of such diseases include heart disease, obesity, and osteoporosis. The stress response evolved to act in short spurts to increase an individual\u2019s odds of survival in the face of immediate danger. It works by temporarily optimizing the body\u2019s performance through the neglect of digestion, growth, reproduction, and immune functions. When this system is abused through the presence of chronic stress, and high levels of glucocorticoids are maintained for long periods, this neglect of important body maintenance functions can lead to various disorders, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and hyperthyroidism.  One mechanism by which stress can lead to certain NCDs is by raising the appeal of an unhealthy lifestyle. Individuals employ coping methods to alleviate stress in the moment, and eventually pay the price for the cumulative impacts. One study found that financial stress over a prolonged period increased an individual\u2019s risk of becoming obese by 20%. Another found that nurses with work schedules at unfavourable hours were more likely to practice unhealthy behaviours, including alcohol consumption and smoking. These nurses, especially those that were female, were also more likely to eat due to stress, and these meals were less likely be nutritious. Unsurprisingly, the authors\u2019 major finding was that nurses with unfavourable schedules were more prone to obesity. Persons experiencing chronic stress are also more likely to take up smoking and ingest more alcohol. However, research suggests that these lifestyle aspects, while detrimental to health, are not the primary cause of an increased risk of stroke and transient ischemic attack. Stress is that primary cause. There has been little evolution in the body\u2019s stress-coping mechanisms over the past several thousand years, despite changes to society and demands from individuals. As a result, a person\u2019s physiological response to the stress of being late for an appointment, worrying about their mark for a test, or losing their job resembles that which occurred in a time when stress was acute and very extreme \u2013 potentially involving risk of death from a predator or from starvation. In developed countries such as the USA and Canada, NCDs are the most common cause of death, and countries around the world that are shifting from agrarian to post-industrial societies are witnessing increasing prevalence of these disorders. Curiously, almost 80% of deaths due to NCDs occur in countries of low to mid-level incomes. Perhaps this is a result of increasingly sedentary lifestyles and rapid urbanization. More than half of the world\u2019s population lives in cities and this number is increasing. Studies demonstrate that individuals brought up in cities have a different response to stress compared to those brought up in a rural environment, even if these people moved to cities as adults. City-dwellers have a relatively large amount of firing in the amygdala and cingulate cortex when presented with a social stressor, indicating a stronger emotional response. Possibly this difference could mean that individuals who grew up in cities are more prone to mental disorders. Given the lag in the evolution of the stress response, it cannot be expected that individuals will experience less activation of the stress response systems in the face of adversity. This fact highlights the importance of work-life balance and taking care of one\u2019s mental health.

Voice by : Marty Henne Support us on Patreon and get early access to videos and free image downloads: patreon.com/AlilaMedicalMedia Supraventricular tachycardia, SVT, refers to rapid heart rhythms that originate above the ventricles, in the atria or AV node.  It\u2019s also called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, for its episodic nature \u2013 the rhythms come suddenly, and go spontaneously. In normal conduction, electrical signals are initiated in the SA node, and travel throughout the atria to reach the AV node. The AV node is the gateway to the ventricles. It delays the passage of electrical impulses to the ventricles to ensure that the atria have ejected all the blood into the ventricles before the ventricles contract.   SVT occurs when abnormal electrical pathways bypass or corrupt the AV nodal checkpoint. As a result, heart rate accelerates, and the ventricles contract before they are properly refilled. These ineffective contractions may cause lightheadedness because the brain is not getting enough oxygen. By definition, SVT includes all rhythms that originate above the ventricles. In practice, however, SVT refers only to AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT), and atrial tachycardia.  AVNRT happens when the AV nodal tissue has 2 pathways with different conductivity, one slow and one fast. If an atrial impulse arrives at the AV node when one pathway is conductive and the other is refractory, it will follow the conductive pathway. However, it may circle back through the second pathway if this becomes excitable again before the signal leaves the node. If this continues, a self-perpetuating loop, called a re-entrant pathway, may arise. With each cycle, the signal is transmitted down to the ventricles. The atrial and ventricular rates are identical, regular and fast. AVNRT is the most common type of SVT in adults, and is twice more common in women than in men. In patients with AVRT, there is an additional connection, an accessory pathway, between the atria and ventricles. The pathway acts as a shortcut to the ventricles, bypassing the AV node. It allows part of electrical impulses to arrive to the ventricles sooner, causing a so-called \u201cpre-excitation\u201d, which can be seen as a shortened PR interval on an ECG. Because part of the ventricles depolarize earlier, ventricular depolarization develops in a more gradual fashion and lasts longer, resulting in a slurring slow rise of the initial portion of the QRS complex, known as Delta wave, and QRS prolongation. However, the presence of the accessory pathway alone is not enough to cause tachycardia. AVRT develops when electrical impulses travel down one pathway, either the normal or accessory, then back up via the other, creating a loop, or re-entrant circuit. The frequency of this loop determines heart rate and can be very fast. AVRT can be orthodromic or antidromic depending on the direction of the loop. AVRT is more common in children. Atrial tachycardia is caused by an ectopic focus in an atrium, and can arise from any of the three mechanisms: enhanced automaticity, reentry, or triggered. Ventricular rhythms are regular and fast. P wave morphology varies depending on the site of origin and tachycardia mechanism. Atrial tachycardia is common in children with congenital heart disease, but it may also be triggered by environmental factors in healthy people. Because of the episodic nature of SVT, symptoms come and go and may not be present during physical examination. ECG findings may be normal, and the condition is often misdiagnosed as anxiety or panic attacks. Assessment should include continuous monitoring with a portable ECG recording device. When SVT is caused by an underlying condition, it must be treated. Most people who have no underlying disease and have an obvious trigger may not require treatment. For others, treatments and lifestyle changes can often control the condition.", "tags": ["arrhythmia", "arrhythmias", "atrial rhythms", "Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia", "atrium", "AVNRT", "cardiac arrhythmias", "cardiac conduction", "cardiac cycle", "cardio", "cardiogram", "cardiology", "cardiovascular", "classification of cardiac arrhythmia", "closed circuit", "diagnosis", "dysrhythmia", "ecg", "Ecg Interpretation", "ecg strip", "ectopic sites", "EKG", "electrical activities of the heart", "electrical activity", "electrical conduction of the heart", "fast heart rate", "health", "healthcare", "heart", "heart diseases"], "comments": 40, "likes": "1772", "channel": {"name": "Alila Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A", "subscribers": "965000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 309.0, "keyword": "Tachycardia (fast heart rate)", "rank": 23, "consine similarity": 0.11864474946906238}

It\u2019s caused by an abnormal lower chamber of the heart. Treatment usually requires medications and, sometimes, ablation procedures. Nishaki Mehta, MD, discusses the uncomfortable symptoms and of this serious condition, which can lead to death.   For more information, visit https://uvahealth.com/services/heart-rhythm/ventricular-tachycardia  Ventricular tachycardia is an abnormal and fast heart rhythm disorder that arises from the lower chambers of the heart, which are called the ventricles. It can be felt as some chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, episodes or near-fainting, or fully, frankly fainting, and in very dangerous conditions it can also lead to death.   Our first approach is to try to optimize the heart tissue and make it as strong as possible with the use of the best medications for that individual. After that, there are a class of medications, called anti-arrhythmic drugs, that can suppress these irregular heart rhythm circuits and prevent them from firing. And then we also have ablation procedures, where we find the regions of the scar where the electrical routes are short-circuiting and causing the ventricular tachycardia.   Once we determine those regions of scar, we perform ablations or destroy that area by applying thermal lesions so that those areas cannot keep firing. So sometimes it\u2019s a combination. It requires the best optimization of the heart. It requires anti-arrhythmic drugs, and ablation procedures. So, no two patients have the same kind of ventricular arrhythmia.   I believe UVA does a fantastic job with ventricular tachycardia management because this condition is complex, and this condition requires very close coordination and input from not just the electrophysiologists, but also the heart failure doctors, the imaging experts. Imaging procedures like cardiac MRI, which are done even with patients with defibrillators here at UVA. And that\u2019s not the case in most centers across the country.", "tags": ["abnormally fast heart rate", "heart rhythm problem", "arrhythmia and chest pain", "irregular heartbeat conditions", "abnormal heart beats", "what is abnormal heart rate", "heart disease types", "common heart issues", "unusual heart beat", "cardiac issues", "serious heart conditions", "arrhythmia of the heart", "unusually fast heart rate", "ventricular tachycardia", "uva", "university of virginia", "vtech heart", "what causes ventricular tachycardia", "what is ventricular arrhythmia", "ventricular beats"], "comments": 8, "likes": "99", "channel": {"name": "uvahealth", "chanenelID": "UCAUMuw4KF1mPdOlxaAbTDmw", "subscribers": "10100"}, "accreditationTag": 1, "duration": 121.0, "keyword": "Tachycardia (fast heart rate)", "rank": 9, "consine similarity": 0.0716114874039433}

{"id": "XIk9kymNmMA", "title": "Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)", "views": "320830", "date_published": "2020-12-06", "description": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD or acid reflux, is a chronic condition in which stomach contents rise and enter the esophagus. This occurs due to problems with closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES, which is the junction between the stomach and esophagus. The most common symptoms are a burning sensation in the chest called heartburn, regurgitation, and an acidic taste in the back of the mouth. Heartburn typically occurs after eating and may worsen at night. Less commonly, people may experience dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing. Dysphagia can manifest as pain when swallowing, a sore throat, choking, coughing, gurgling or regurgitating food or stomach acids, feeling that food is stuck behind your breastbone, a burning sensation behind your breastbone, and hoarseness. There may also be nausea, frequent burping, chest pain, the sensation of a lump in your throat, wearing away of teeth, and bad breath. GERD can cause a recurrent cough, breathing difficulties, chest congestion, and lung inflammation leading to asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Complications that can occur from it include esophagitis, or inflammation of esophagus, esophageal stricture, in which scar tissue develops and narrows the esophagus, and Barrett\u2019s esophagus, in which the lining of the esophagus comes to resemble tissue that lines the intestines \u2013 which can lead to cancer. Risk factors for GERD include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, and certain medications. Hence, treatments include lifestyle changes such as losing weight and quitting smoking. Other lifestyle changes include eating several small meals a day instead of 3 big meals, avoiding food resulting in symptoms, not lying down 2-3 hours after eating, and raising the head of the bed. Foods that can exacerbate GERD symptoms include spicy, fatty, or fried foods, garlic, onions, citrus fruits, tomatoes, caffeine, and fizzy drinks. There are also medications that can be used to treat GERD symptoms. These include proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, and histamine-2 (or H2) receptor blockers, both of which reduce stomach acid production. There are also prokinetics, which cause the stomach to empty more quickly, antacids, which neutralize acid in the stomach, and medications that strengthen the LES. Some people still have symptoms interfering with their quality of life despite lifestyle changes and taking medication. Still others wish to avoid taking medication long-term. In such cases, surgeries can be performed to reinforce and strengthen the LES. The most common of these is Nissan fundoplication. In this surgery, the stomach\u2019s fundus is wrapped around the LES. During a total fundoplication, the fundus is wrapped 360 degrees around. In a partial fundoplication, the fundus is not wrapped completely around the stomach. Some people with GERD may have a hiatal hernia, which is when part of the stomach slips through the diaphragm into the middle compartment of the chest. If a hiatal hernia is present, that is also fixed during the surgery. Asthma and GERD frequently occur together. The reason is not certain, but it is believed that acid flowing from the stomach injures the throat lining, airways, and lungs. Another potential cause could be that when acid enters the esophagus, a nerve reflex kicks in and constricts airways to keep acid out. This can result in shortness of breath.", "tags": ["GERD", "gastroesophageal reflux disease", "acid reflux", "heart burn", "esophagitis", "Barrett's", "esophagus", "stomach", "sour stomach", "causes", "symptoms", "food", "foods", "triggers", "pills", "medication", "PPI", "H2", "blockers", "surgery", "nissan", "fundoplication", "total", "partial", "basics", "asthma", "asthma and gerd", "esophageal stricture"], "comments": 722, "likes": "4073", "channel": {"name": "Neural Academy", "chanenelID": "UCqKiDBaeIA61KZxUqWHNb6w", "subscribers": "497000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 211.0, "keyword": "acid reflux", "rank": 11, "consine similarity": 0.09245003270420485}

More breathing exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7-CAFhJn78  \r\rI start off with Square breathing. It\u2019s so good at helping to relieve stress and anxiety that it\u2019s sometimes used in the military to help calm nerves before stressful situations.  It\u2019s performed just how it sounds--using your breath to make a square. Use imagery as well and imagine making a square or following something with a square pattern with your breath. Each position is 4 seconds. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, and hold your breath again for 4 seconds.   \r\rPursed breathing is another breathing technique that can help relieve stress and anxiety, and it can also help make your lungs stronger. For this one, use diaphragmatic or belly breathing. Breathe in for 4 seconds, and then breathe out with pursed lips for 8 seconds.

{"id": "VSS7LZxrbhk", "title": "Shortfall of Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)", "views": "2303", "date_published": "2018-10-08", "description": "https://buteykoclinic.com/ - Buteyko Clinic International  Obstructive Sleep Apnea Traits: During wakefulness, the airway is held open by the high activity of the numerous upper airway dilator muscles, but after the onset of sleep, when muscle activity is reduced, the airway collapses.  Collapse of the upper airway occurs if the negative upper airway pressure generated by inspiratory pump muscles exceeds the dilating force of these upper airway muscles.   Obstructive sleep apnoea is a common disorder of repetitive pharyngeal collapse during sleep. Pharyngeal collapse could be complete (causing apnoea) or partial (causing hypopnea).   The best test for obstructive sleep apnoea is overnight polysomnography in a laboratory with the primary outcome measure of apnoea- hypopnea index (number of apnoeas plus hypopnoeas per h or sleep) This test involves concurrent monitoring of both sleep and respiration.   Despite the quality of neurophysiological signals obtained during an overnight PSG, most of the data collected is ignored and treatment decisions rely heavily on the AHI.  AHI has several limitations: For example, a patient with very long respiratory events may experience substantial hypoxemia but have a relatively low AHI. Another patient may have more frequent events and therefore a much higher AHI, but minimal exposure to hypoxemia.  In addition, non-apneic respiratory events that do not meet the scoring criteria for a hypopnea are associated with heart rate changes and increased respiratory pharyngeal resistance.  Furthermore, the total AHI correlates poorly with the key causes and consequences of the disease.   Traditionally, obstructive sleep apnoea was considered to primarily be a problem of upper airway anatomy, where craniofacial structure or body fat decreased the size of the pharyngeal airway lumen, leading to an increased likelihood of pharyngeal collapse.  Anatomical: The upper airway can collapse at one or multiple sites. The pharyngeal structures that can contribute to airway crowding and collapse include the dilator muscles such as genioglossus, soft palate, lateral pharyngeal walls, and the epiglottis.

Do you find that you're more forgetful than you used to be, or sometimes zone out during the day? You may be suffering from brain fog. Brain fog can be a side effect of cancer or some cancer treatment and medications. Brain fog can last for a short time, or it may go on for years.Luckily, there are things you can do to help lessen day-to-day difficulties that come with cancer-related brain fog, including eating a healthy diet.  A healthy diet can help keep your mind working well by providing a steady source of fuel and nutrients. For a healthy brain, follow these tips: - Power up with protein. Your brain needs protein to help you do your daily tasks and to regulate your mood. - Go for whole grains. Whole grains contain brain boosting nutrients like folate, zinc, and magnesium. - Get more vegetables and fruit. Choose vegetables and fruit in a variety of colours to get the widest variety of antioxidants. - Own those Omega-3s. Find them in foods like fatty fish, walnuts, and some seeds and their oils, like flax. - Get enough fluids. Dehydration can cause poor concentration.

{"id": "upIJpqWc0y4", "title": "Grinding Teeth (Bruxism) - A Major Cause of Gum Recession", "views": "128482", "date_published": "2018-02-19", "description": "Bruxism, or grinding teeth is one of the major causes of gum recession. This condition is also known as TMJ. Grinding teeth at night can cause the teeth to shift, move and become more likely to recede.   When you clench or grind your teeth, you put pressure on the blood vessels that supply nourishment to the gum tissue and the bone. This causes it to become more fragile and makes the teeth more susceptible to recession or loss.   WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS OF BRUXISM?   Age \u2013 it is common in younger children but they will usually grow out             of it by maturity.  Personality \u2013 Anger and frustration as well as aggressive,             competitive or overactive personalities may increase the             chance of grinding teeth.  Medications - Medications, such as some anti-depressants, caffeine,                  alcohol, smoking or recreational drugs can increase your risk             of bruxism.  Stress \u2013 Increased apprehension or worry can lead to teeth grinding.             Also, anger and frustration.  Genetics - Surprisingly, bruxism can occur in families. If you have it,             other family members may also have it or have had it in the             past.  Other Causes \u2013 It can even be linked with several medical and             mental health conditions like dementia, gastro esophageal             reflux disorder (GERD), epilepsy, night terrors, Parkinson's             disease and ADHD.  HOW TO PREVENT DAMAGE FROM GRINDING TEETH?  1. Get a mouth guard/night guard, this minimized the damaging       forces from grinding.  2. Occlusal Adjustment. This is reshaping the teeth which also       minimized the damage from bruxism 3. Eliminate grinding triggers. This option is best exercised through       stress therapy and changing habits that might contribute to       Bruxism.   WHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE GUM RECESSION?  The Pinhole Gum Rejuvenation Technique is an excellent option for treating gum recession. It is generally pain-free and lasts a lifetime.

(Symptoms, Causes, Treatment, Prevention) - https://healthery.com/health/mild-cognitive-impairment/  Presented by healthery.com  Individuals experience minimal memory loss and episodes of unclear thinking. It doesn't prevent daily activities and does not require a caregiver. Those with this condition usually realize they are having memory problems.   What are the Symptoms of Mild Cognitive Impairment? There are two distinct types called amnestic and nonamnestic. Amnestic symptoms include memory loss, such as forgetting a name or appointment. Nonamnestic symptoms include decision making problems & a lack of organization. Those diagnosed should visit a medical professional once or twice a year. The visit is for testing and to make sure the condition is not getting worse.   What are the Causes of Mild Cognitive Impairment? The causes of MCI are not fully understood. It is thought that the early stages lead to a more serious disorder, such as: Alzheimer\u2019s, but this may not always be the case. Several factors increase an individual\u2019s risk of developing MCI. These risk factors are the same as for dementia. The risk of developing MCI increases with age and may have a genetic component. Including a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia. As well as age-related cognitive decline, are most at risk. People at risk of developing cardiovascular disease are also at most risk. This may be because cardiovascular issues can affect blood flow to the brain. Which potentially deprives the brain of oxygen and other nutrients. Over time this may result in cell death. Specific risk factors for cardiovascular disease include: Obesity, smoking, consuming large amounts of alcohol and eating unhealthy diets.  How is Mild Cognitive Impairment Treated? There is no medical treatment for Mild Cognitive Impairment. It's recommended to change daily habits to slow down memory loss. Such treatments include daily exercise and eating nutritious meals. Which include lean protein, vegetables, fruits and grains. It's suggested to routinely stimulate the mind with mental & social activities. Examples include working on crossword puzzles and conversing with other people.  How is Mild Cognitive Impairment Prevented? Studies show that lowering blood pressure is an effective way of preventing MCI. Reducing the amount of fat in your diet, lowering your cholesterol levels and cutting back salt intake are all steps toward controlling blood pressure. Physical exercise is particularly important in the prevention of MCI. Causing brain cell growth, making it more efficient at using the cells it has. Studies show that exercise slows down cognitive decline and can reverse it. As well as dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s and other age-related cognitive issues. However, such preventive measure cannot remove the risk completely.  If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe! This video is meant for educational purposes and is not medical advice.

{"id": "mOpSeVBA_AU", "title": "What is CPAP? (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) | Respiratory Therapy Zone", "views": "30063", "date_published": "2020-06-20", "description": "What is CPAP? This video will teach you all about Continuous Positive Airway Pressure! \ud83d\udca5Full Guide on CPAP \u279c \u279c \u279c https://bit.ly/2Ste6Ms  \u27a1\ufe0f What is CPAP? Before we get deeper into the content, one important thing to remember about CPAP is that it can only be delivered if the patient is breathing spontaneously because it does not provide any mechanical breaths.   \u27a1\ufe0f So go ahead and engrave that into your memory: Never administer or recommend CPAP for a patient who is not breathing spontaneously.  In general, noninvasive ventilation delivers an inspiratory pressure (IPAP) and an expiratory pressure (EPAP), but CPAP is active when both pressures are equal. Because if you think about it, that's where CPAP gets its name \u2014 Continuous Positive Airway Pressure \u2014 because a continuous pressure is being delivered throughout both the inspiratory and expiratory phase of breathing.   The primary indication for CPAP is:  Obstructive Sleep Apnea  Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition where the patient has five episodes of apnea that last at least 10 seconds each within a one-hour time period while asleep. This type of sleep apnea is caused by an airflow obstruction that occurs along with continuous breathing efforts by the patient. But for now, just know that patients can wear a CPAP mask at night while asleep and the continuous positive airway pressure that is applied helps to decrease the apnea episodes by keeping the airway open to overcome the obstruction.   \u27a1\ufe0f Contraindications for CPAP: Apnea Hypoventilation Respiratory muscle fatigue Facial burns or trauma Claustrophobia   \u27a1\ufe0f CPAP in Traditional Mechanical Ventilation CPAP can be delivered as a spontaneous breathing mode is traditional mechanical ventilation and is commonly used along with Pressure Support when attempts are made to wean a patient from the ventilator. When the CPAP mode is in use, the patient must be monitored carefully for fatigue because they are the one that is doing all the work. Since it is a spontaneous mode, the machine will not deliver any breaths. It just provides a continuous pressure that helps supports the patient's own breathing cycle. But the machine does not contribute to the minute ventilation. That is all done by the patient.   \u27a1\ufe0f So for patients who are receiving CPAP, you should monitor them for signs of fatigue, which are: Dyspnea Tachycardia Increasing PaCO2 level Increasing respiratory rate Decreasing tidal volume or vital capacity Decreasing MIP  In these cases, you would most likely be able to tell that the patient is working harder than normal to breathe and you'd likely notice some usage of the accessory muscles of breathing, which is a sign of respiratory distress. When these signs are present, the patient should be switched from CPAP back to a conventional mode of ventilation.

This step by step guide to coughing phlegm out of your lungs combines the physiotherapy techniques of deep breathing, huffing and coughing to clear the lungs most effectively. Physiotherapist and chest patient demonstration from https://www.pelvicexercises.com.au  Effective Coughing involves:   1. Correct coughing posture sitting upright with the back well supported  2. Deep breathing exercises to encourage increased ventilation and movement of lung secretions (phlegm) to the central bronchi (airways). These exercises involve expanding the base of the rib cage with slow deep breaths and allowing the air to passively leave the body without force.  3. The Huff (forced expiratory technique) to draw phlegm from the outer lungs to the central airways making it easier to cough up phlegm. This technique involves taking in a medium size breath and then breathing out forcefully through an open mouth and glottis. The huff creates negative pressure in the lungs that draws phlegm towards the large central airways from the smaller outer airways.  4. Coughing after the huff technique with your mouth covered in the direction away from others helps prevent the spread of virus and bacteria. The cough will often become more productive during the hour or so following the huff exercise.   How Many Times to do this Coughing Routine?   The technique demonstrated can be performed 1-2 times in a row no more than once hourly. Doing this whole breathing, huffing and coughing routine twice a day, ideally morning and night help can help you clear your chest and cough more effectively. During exacerbation for example with bronchitis, virus or pneumonia (resolution) this technique can used more often throughout the day if required. Limit using the technique to every couple of hours to avoid feeling breathless.   The Coughing and Breathing Cycle (ACBT) involves:  *Correct upright posture  *3-5 deep breathing exercises  *Relaxed breathing  *3-5 deep breathing exercises  *Relaxed breathing  *1-2 huffs  *Cough   Transcribe video: http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=bXJkZ5fGU7c  Reference: van der Schans CP (1997) Forced expiratory manoeuvres to increase transport of bronchial mucus: a mechanistic approach.

Warning If you feel pain when using acupressure, stop immediately. Pregnant women should not use acupressure.   Step 1: Press beneath your collarbone Using the index and middle fingers on each hand, press the two spots located on either side of the notch at the base of the throat, in the hollow just below the collarbone. This strengthens the respiratory system. Keep the pressure up for one to three minutes with this exercise and the following ones.   Step 2: Reach behind you Reach behind you to press the acupressure points known as the Vital Diaphragm, located about an inch below the highest point of each shoulder blade, toward the center of your back.   Tip Have someone else press points on your back if you can't reach.   Step 3: Tilt your head down Tilt your head down and, using the first two fingers on each hand, put pressure on the points a bit above and on either side of the vertabra that protrudes at the top of the spine when your head is leaning forward. This manipulates the point known as Ding Chuan, which relieves wheezing.   Step 4: Relieve a dry cough For a dry cough, try pressing the point called Heaven Rushing Out: It\u2019s located in the large hollow at the base of your throat, below your Adam's apple, if you're a man.

If you find that you\u2019re still tired even after sleeping all night, this is called excessive daytime sleepiness.\u00a0  When you go to bed, there are waves of hormones that occur. There are four 90 minute cycles, and when you go through these waves, there are different levels of sleep. The goal is to get into delta sleep, which is when you really recharge.\u00a0  What prevents you from getting into the delta sleep wave, or makes you tired all the time?  1. Vitamin D deficiency\u00a0 2. Not enough fermented foods 3. Not enough omega 3 fatty acids\u00a0 4. EMF\u00a0 5. Chronic infection  Talk to a Product Advisor to find the best product for you!

Within this video I teach you how to get better sleep by giving you one simple trick on how to improve your sleep, fall asleep faster, and stay asleep all night long.   THE ONE SIMPLE TRICK IS..  The Tim Ferris Sleep Concoction: 1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar 1 Tbsp Raw Honey 1 Glass of Warm Water --- Drink Before Bed ---  MORE TIPS FOR BETTER SLEEP:  TIP #1: Develop a Sleep Cycle There is a function that we all have called the circadian rhythm that regulates all of the body's physiological processes including when you go to sleep at night and when you wake up in the morning. By developing a sleep schedule and going to bed at the same time each night and waking up at the same time each morning, we can work WITH our circadian rhythm instead of AGAINST it. Developing a sleep schedule also helps you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, resulting in improved mood, focus, and job performance, as well as increased longevity and a handful of other health benefits.   TIP #2: Avoid Caffeine After 12 O'clock Noon: Caffeine has an 8 hour half life, meaning that if you consume caffeine, 8 hours later half of that caffeine is still present in your central nervous system. This can inhibit the body's ability to get a proper nights sleep, ultimately causing many health issues.  TIP #3: Avoid Screen Time Before Bed To ensure a quality nights sleep, we should limit the time that we spend before bed looking at screens that emit off blue light (TV, iPads, iPods, Cell Phones, Laptops, etc.). Blue light restricts the release of melatonin (the sleep hormone) causing you to have difficulties getting into REM sleep optimally. One hour before bed, stop looking at all screens and allow your body to naturally wind down.  TIP #4: Avoid LONG Naps Power naps (10-30 minutes) are beneficial, increasing focus, reaction time, alertness, and performance while at work. However, LONG naps (Anything over 30 minutes) can actually inhibit your ability to get proper sleep at night. Save sleep for bed time and you will reap the health benefits that follow this good habit.  I hope this helped!  Don't forget to comment! GIVE ME SOME FEEDBACK!!! Always grateful for a Like!

We all do it, but what happens to us when we sleep?  Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy   Every night almost everyone on the planet enters into a state of unconsciousness and paralysis - but what is really happening inside the body when we drift off, and what's the impact if we don't get enough sleep?  Sleep is regulated by your circadian rhythm, or body clock located in the brain. The body clock responds to light hews ramping up production of the hormone melatonin at night, and switching it off when it senses light.   There are four stages of sleep that the body experiences in cycles throughout the night. On a good night we cycle through these stages four or five times.   Stages one and two are light sleep. This is a transition from being awake to falling asleep. Heart rate and breathing begin to slow, body temperature falls, and muscles may twitch. Stage 3 is sometimes referred to as Delta sleep - because of the slow Delta brainwaves that are released during this stage. This is the first stage of deep sleep where our cells produce the most growth hormone to service bones and muscles, allowing the body to repair itself. Stage 4 is where we begin to dream. The body creates chemicals that render it temporarily paralyzed so that we do not act out our dreams. In this stage, the brain is extremely active and our eyes, although closed, dark back and forth as if we were awake.  Humans roughly spend one third of their lives asleep. Modern lifestyles, stress and the proliferation of Technology, mean that people is sleeping far less today than they were a century ago.   Sleeping less than seven hours per day is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions which could reduce life expectancy.

How this works. What is a yawn? Yawning is a mostly involuntary process of opening the mouth and breathing in deeply, filling the lungs with air. It\u2019s a very natural response to being tired. In fact, yawning is usually triggered by sleepiness or fatigue.  Some yawns are short, and some last for several seconds before an open-mouthed exhale. Watery eyes, stretching, or audible sighs may accompany yawning.  Researchers aren\u2019t exactly sure why yawning occurs, but common triggers include fatigue and boredom. Yawns may also occur when you talk about yawning or see or hear someone else yawn.  It\u2019s believed that contagious yawning may have something to do with social communication. In addition, a 2013 study published in the International Journal of Applied and Basic Medical Research suggests that yawning may help cool the temperature of the brain.  Excessive yawning is yawning that occurs more than once per minute. Although excessive yawning is usually attributed to being sleepy or bored, it may be a symptom of an underlying medical problem.  Certain conditions can cause a vasovagal reaction, which results in excessive yawning. During a vasovagal reaction, there\u2019s increased activity in the vagus nerve. This nerve runs from the brain down to the throat and into the abdomen.  When the vagus nerve becomes more active, heart rate and blood pressure drop significantly. The reaction can indicate anything from a sleep disorder to a serious heart condition.

M. Balaji, Craniofacial Surgeon, Chennai, for surgical repair of the cleft. Dr. Balaji preferred to perform the Wardill-Kilner procedure to repair the cleft.  The patient\u2019s mandible was extremely micrognathic and general anesthesia was administered with great dexterity and skill since intubation was very difficult because of small mouth size.  Surgical approach intraorally was very difficult to achieve, again because of the extremely small size of the oral aperture and Dr. Balaji used his expertise and skill to execute this surgical procedure to perfection.  A vomerine flap was first raised and then a nasal layer was raised. Through an incision on the hard palate, a palatal flap was also raised and the greater palatine artery was exposed. At this juncture, the nasal mucosa was carefully separated. An osteotomy of the greater palatine foramen and canal was carried out taking great care to prevent postoperative tension in that region, which could lead to potential problems. The medial and lateral flaps from the mucogingival tissues were then raised. Using a Howarth elevator, the palatal mucosa was elevated. While operating on the contralateral side, the left hand was used for making the incisions. The nasal mucosa was sutured to create an anatomically normal nasal cavity. The muscle attachments were then carefully identified. The levator palatini was detached and sutured to the point of correct attachment of the muscle. Throughout the procedure, great care was taken in handling the greater palatine vessels.  A muscle sling was established.  The greater palatine artery was moved away from the canal to aid in repositioning of the flap. At the end of this procedure, suturing was commenced from anterior to posterior direction and then towards the uvula.  Horizontal and then vertical mattress sutures were then placed.  Dead space between nasal and palatal mucosa was eliminated.  For this, a reinforcement bite was taken from the nasal mucosa  For Questions & queries : smbalaji@gmail.com Website: www.smbalaji.com", "tags": ["Dr SM Balaji", "Balaji Dental Hospital", "Maxillofacial Surgeon", "Cleft Palate Surgery", "Dental Surgeon", "Pierre Robin Micrognathia"], "comments": 0, "likes": "19", "channel": {"name": "BALAJI SM", "chanenelID": "UCfd6CkHukFOvlJMC82wiIxw", "subscribers": "17100"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 155.0, "keyword": "micrognathia", "rank": 3, "consine similarity": 0.07905694150420949}

{"id": "rF8BZOK1ll4", "title": "At what age do children stop taking naps?", "views": "7333", "date_published": "2015-02-27", "description": "Naps are very important for both kids and parents, because, for parents, it's a break during the day, a time to get things done, or to rest yourself. And for kids, it's a time to rejuvenate and to get the necessary sleep they need, especially when children are young - they need it for their growing brains and their development. There's not a one-size-fits-all nap equation that says that kids at certain ages should sleep a certain amount, but there are general guidelines, or maybe norms. For example, most kids take naps until between the ages of 1 and 2 for sure, and then after that, some kids give it up. Other kids continue to nap until they're 5 years of age and go to kindergarten.  So really, what it comes down to is how your child is doing with or without naps. For example, sometimes naps can interrupt bedtime, and nap schedules need to be adjusted. Or sometimes toddlers want to give the nap up and you notice that your child is unusually cranky, or aggressive, or has a hard time getting up in the morning once they've given them up. If this sounds like your child, then what you can do is try to enforce quiet time. During the same time that you would give your child a nap, turn the lights low, get rid of distractions, have your child go into their room and read a book or do something quiet. And oftentimes, parents are surprised by the fact that this will turn into sleep. The child will often decide that there's nothing else exciting going on, they feel sleepy, they get into their bed, and they actually do sleep.  The amount of time a child will sleep during a nap will vary by age. For example, babies that are 0 to 6 months of age will probably still take good naps during the day, like at least 2 to 3. And they can be 20 minutes long or they can be as long as 2 to 3 hours. It just really depends on how well they're sleeping at night and what their individual needs are. As a child gets older, they may drop some naps and go from 3 to 2, and over the age of 1, from 2 to 1. And so as long as a child is getting good nighttime sleep, in combination with good daytime sleep as necessary, then that's what matters most. If you're child is happy, healthy, growing, and meeting milestones, then that's what you need to watch for. That's what is important.  Let's say you have a toddler that's 2 1/2 years old, they're acting like they're not really wanting to nap anymore, but they're sleeping a good solid 13 hours at night and happy during the day, then it's okay that they're letting naps go. But if you notice that they're only sleeping 9 to 10 hours at night, they're cranky during the day, then it would be good to continue enforcing naps. And the best way to do this is to develop a routine and stick to it as much as possible.

According to WebMD, this can lead to what\u2019s known as hypoxia, \u201cwhen your blood doesn\u2019t carry enough oxygen to your tissues to meet your body\u2019s needs,\u201d although hypoxia is often used to describe both conditions.  This can occur suddenly as a result of taking certain medications or having an asthma attack, or develop over time due to heart problems or lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and emphysema. Although symptoms of hypoxia often vary from person to person, the following are the five most common ones to be aware of. 1. Skin Color Changes  As red blood cells are what carry oxygen to the body\u2019s tissues, an insufficient amount of them can cause the skin to change color. Known as cyanosis, the skin will typically appear a dark bluish-red, and is most noticeable if oxygen levels drops dramatically.  For those with darker skin colors, MedlinePlus says cyanosis \u201cmay be easier to see in the mucous membranes (lips, gums, around the eyes) and nails.\u201d  2. Confusion  The NHS defines a state of confusion as \u201cnot being able to think clearly or quickly, feeling disorientated, and struggling to pay attention, make decisions, or remember things.\u201d  If you notice yourself or someone else suddenly exhibiting any of these symptoms, it may be an indication of hypoxia. Sudden hypoxia could be caused by a variety of reasons, from a severe asthma attack to a problem with the heart or lungs.  3. Coughing  One of the most common causes of hypoxia is a severe asthma attack, during which it can be hard to get sufficient air into the lungs as the airways have narrowed. In an attempt to clear the lungs, a person may cough frequently.  While this is a natural reaction, it can prove dangerous as WebMD says \u201ccoughing to clear your lungs uses even more oxygen and can make symptoms worse.\u201d  4. Rapid Heart Rate and Breathing  An increased heart rate most often occurs when engaging in physical activity, so if it happens while at rest it may be an indication of hypoxia. When the body isn\u2019t receiving sufficient oxygen, Livestrong.com says that the heart begins pumping faster in order to \u201chelp circulate oxygen-containing blood throughout the body in an attempt to meet the cells\u2019 needs.\u201d  Breathing also becomes more rapid when the body\u2019s oxygen needs aren\u2019t being met, in an effort to increase intake. While people normally breathe at a rate of 12 to 16 times per minute, in these situations rates may increase to 24 breaths or higher.  5. Shortness of Breath  Shortness of breath is considered one of the most obvious symptoms of hypoxia, and often occurs as a result of the increased heart rate and breathing mentioned previously. It often occurs while at rest, and can become so severe that it feels as though you\u2019re choking.  Shortness of breath will be especially pronounced when engaging in physical activities, and may decrease one\u2019s tolerance for them. It may also happen during sleep, causing you to wake up out of breath. In some cases, shortness of breath may also be accompanied by wheezing, a high-pitched whistling sound that occurs when breathing, particularly exhaling.", "tags": ["symptoms of chronic low blood oxygen", "symptoms of low blood oxygen can cause", "symptoms of low blood oxygen carrying", "differential diagnosis of low blood oxygen", "symptoms of low blood oxygen and blood", "symptoms of low blood oxygen and exercise", "symptoms of low blood oxygen chart", "symptoms of low blood oxygen complications", "symptoms of low blood oxygen cause", "symptoms of low blood oxygen cures", "symptoms of low blood oxygen and dementia", "symptoms low oxygen levels copd"], "comments": 47, "likes": "1100", "channel": {"name": "Health Zone", "chanenelID": "UCfR3Y90G-fFDYI6i7E7xPBQ", "subscribers": "30200"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 286.0, "keyword": "oxygen desaturation", "rank": 24, "consine similarity": 0.04463218426774518}

The temporomandibular joint \u2013 the TMJ - is the joint between the lower jawbone - the mandible - and the temporal bone of the skull. The TMJ is responsible for jaw movement and enables chewing, talking and yawning. Temporomandibular disorders, or TMD, refer to a group of conditions characterized by pain in the jaw area and limited movement of the mandible. TMD may be caused by problems in the joint itself or in the muscles surrounding the joint. Problems in the joint include: arthritis, inflammation and internal derangements. When the problem is in the muscles, the condition is called myofascial pain syndrome.   Myofascial pain syndrome is very common and can occur in patients with a normal temporomandibular joint. The syndrome is characterized by presence of hyperirritable spots located in skeletal muscles called trigger points. A trigger point can be felt as a nodule of muscle with harder than normal consistency. Palpation of trigger points may elicit pain in a different location. This is called referred pain.  Trigger points are developed as a result of muscle overuse. Commonly, the muscles of chewing, or mastication, are overworked when patients excessively clench or grind their teeth unconsciously during sleep. The medical term for this condition is \u201cnocturnal bruxism\u201d. A trigger point is composed of many contraction knots where individual muscle fibers contract and cannot relax. The sustained contraction of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply, resulting in energy shortage of the area. This metabolic crisis activates pain receptors, generating a regional pain pattern that follows a specific nerve passage. The pain patterns are therefore consistent and are well documented for various muscles.  Trigger points in the masseter refer pain to the cheeks, lower jaw, upper and lower molar teeth, eyebrow, inside the ear and around the TMJ area. Trigger points in the temporalis are also associated with headache and toothache from upper teeth. The main culprits of myofascial pain in the TMJ area are the pterygoid muscles. Trigger points in medial pterygoid refer pain to the TMJ region in front of the ear, inside the mouth and upper outside of the neck. They may also manifest as sore throat and difficulty swallowing. Pain from lateral pterygoid trigger points can be felt in front of the ear and on the upper jaw.  Treatments aim to address bruxism, to relieve muscle spasm and release trigger points. Treatment options include:  - Therapies: stress management, behavior therapy, biofeedback - to encourage relaxation. - Dental night guards: Splints and mouth guards - to protect the teeth from damage. - Medication: pain relievers, muscle relaxants, botox injections. - Trigger points release techniques such as needling and \u201cspray and stretch\u201d.", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "Myofascial Pain Syndrome (Disease Or Medical Condition)", "Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction (Disease Or Medical Condition)", "Pain (Symptom)", "Health (Industry)", "Animation", "anatomy", "animated", "chiropractic", "dental", "dentist", "dentistry", "health", "healthcare", "jaw pain", "mastication muscles", "medical", "medicine", "MPS", "musculoskeletal", "pain management", "patient education", "temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome", "TMD", "TMJ", "TMJD", "treatments", "trigger point complex", "trigger points", "pain patterns"], "comments": 594, "likes": "9292", "channel": {"name": "Alila Medical Media", "chanenelID": "UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A", "subscribers": "965000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 246.0, "keyword": "pain in front center of brain", "rank": 21, "consine similarity": 0.06608186004550898}

Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack, where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked.  There are many possible causes of SCA. They include coronary heart disease, physical stress, and some inherited disorders. Sometimes there is no known cause for the SCA.  Without medical attention, the person will die within a few minutes. People are less likely to die if they have early defibrillation. Defibrillation sends an electric shock to restore the heart rhythm to normal. You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.  If you have had an SCA, an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chance of dying from a second SCA.", "tags": "NA", "comments": 144, "likes": "1709", "channel": {"name": "Rehealthify", "chanenelID": "UCB5a4eG55pmif3c2OXodIYw", "subscribers": "94900"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 116.0, "keyword": "pulmonary arrest", "rank": 24, "consine similarity": 0.07624928516630233}

Too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your body's organs.  Diseases and conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. Examples include      Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and cystic fibrosis     Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy and stroke     Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage.

We try to find rest in our social status, wealth, different forms of physical comfort, and so on. All of these pursuits leave us longing for something more though.

It\u2019s the kind of rest we cannot obtain on our own, but we need to be open to receive it from our Lord.

Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.  The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.  You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils or adenoids may also get it.  Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.  When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (or apnea) is characterised by upper airway obstruction during sleep resulting in intermittent hypoxia. Obstructive sleep apnoea is well-known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but is also connected with other diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  Dr Hazlehurst's work investigates the mechanisms by which the liver metabolises fat to find out more about the connection between obstructive sleep apnoea and fatty liver disease. His experiments indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis but antagonism of the glucocorticoid receptor is unlikely to prevent the associated metabolic disease.

Well, I feel tired at school it's hard to wake up. I've been finding her very irritable during the days.A little bit cranky. Falling asleep in the afternoon and when she's sleeping she's snoring and sometimes they hear her gasp for breath. Sounds a lot like she might have obstructive sleep apnea. So the only way for us to know for sure is to do something called a sleep study. So I'll go ahead and get that organized. What's a sleep study? What a great question.  Let me tell you a little bit about it. So one of the days after dinner when we arrange it you'll come with your mom or your dad. I open to the sleep lab so that we can get information while you're sleeping and then in the morning you get to go home. It sounds just like a sleepovers. You love sleepovers. You can bring your pillow and your book and make yourself comfortable. So sleep study test is to look for any problems that occur during sleep such as sleep apnea and sleep apnea occurs when you snore and may have pauses in breathing during the night causing sleep fragmentation.   Nice to meet you. Welcome to the sleep lab. My name is Colin. I'll be your sleep technologist today. I'll be taking care of you. So what the sleep study test will do we'll put a band around the chest to look for breathing movements. The thing about them is they have to be relatively tight because they're a lot easier to loosen. Once they aren't, you then to taking them. So I'm gonna make it pretty tight but then we'll loosen it until you're comfortable ok.   What the sleep study test will do is we will put eg leads and on the head to measure the brainwaves. We'll also put on EKG leads to measure the heart rate and the rhythm. I will put on a probe and on the finger to measure oxygen levels.   The goal for our sleep study is generally to determine whether a child has sleep disorder breathing and to what degree. At that point we would determine the best management plan for the patient be it surgical or therapeutic. So if your child is diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, the first step would be to move forward with an ear nose and throat assessment for the size of the adenoids and tonsils. And if in fact the adenoids and tonsils are enlarged, then we would recommend an adenoidtonsillectomy. In general after that tonsils energy not being removed we'll do another sleep study four to six months after the surgery to see if the surgery fix the problem completely.  Throughout the night. Mom is right there. You can wake her up tell her to come get me. If you don't feel comfortable coming out in the hallway, there's a little button right there just press that little button on the wall and it sends a beep into my office if you need anything.   Okay. Also, you are on candid camera tonight. I will be watching you sleep. I will be checking in on you to make sure you're safe and that sort of thing okay? Morning. How did you sleep? How do you feel right now? Good? You ready to get all that stuff off your face? If still there are problems with sleep apnea, we will bring the family to the clinic to discuss other treatment options.", "tags": ["sleep study", "polysomnogram", "what happens during a sleep study", "what happens during a polysomnogram", "sleep studies for children", "should i take my child for a sleep study", "sleep apnea", "sleep apnea in children", "sleep clinic", "child always tired", "snoring", "my child snores", "obstructive sleep apnea", "sleep study test", "does my child have sleep apnea", "sleep disorder", "positive airway pressure", "does my child have a sleep disorder", "sleep disorders in children", "sleep disorder test"], "comments": 2, "likes": "24", "channel": {"name": "AboutKidsHealth", "chanenelID": "UCvHCw-Pc9Cl9VeZrvEVldEw", "subscribers": "57000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 242.0, "keyword": "sleep study", "rank": 21, "consine similarity": 0.08481889296799709}

Today\u2019s families face many healthy sleep challenges. Things like busy work and school schedules, ever-present technology, and extra-curricular activity overload mean many families sleep routines can be easily disrupted. On top of that, recent studies suggest nearly 20% of all children may suffer from some type of sleep problem. Whatever the cause, the Sleep Disorders Program at Nationwide Children's Hospital and our Sleep Medicine Clinics, help patients with poor sleep habits and more serious underlying medical conditions. The Disorders Center performs more than 850 overnight sleep studies annually.  Sleep studies are often ordered to find out if a child has problems breathing while asleep. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most common reasons for doing a sleep study. It is often found in children who snore, gasp for air, or stop breathing while asleep.  Children with enlarged tonsils may also have apnea. However, there are many other reasons why your doctor may want your child to have these tests.

It helps by increasing the overall muscle tone of the tongue and mouth thereby minimizing vibration and collapse from muscle flaccidity. In a recent meta-analysis, these exercises have been shown to decrease snoring intensity by 51% and decrease time spent snoring by 31%.   Easily performed at home, there are 6 basic exercises to do. Each exercise should be performed for 5 seconds and repeated a total of 3 or more times. Each set should be performed 2 or more times a day. If properly performed, you should feel tongue and throat muscle strain and fatigue.  Exercise #1: Stick Tongue Out (0:42) Exercise #2: Suction the Tongue to Roof of Mouth (1:18) Exercise #3: Push Tongue to Sides (1:45) Exercise #4: Drop Tongue Down into Throat (2:01) Exercise #5: While Pushing Tongue Against Teeth, Swallow (2:10) Exercise #6: Vowel Exercises (2:21) Didgeridoo (2:42)  Video produced by Dr. Chris Chang: https://www.FauquierENT.net  For more info on snoring: https://www.FauquierENT.net/snoring.htm  For more info on sleep apnea: https://www.FauquierENT.net/osa.htm  For more info on sleep endoscopy: https://www.FauquierENT.net/sleependoscopy.htm  Check out our online snore store: https://www.FauquierENT.net/store_snore.htm  References: Oropharyngeal and tongue exercises (myofunctional therapy) for snoring: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

The salt helps in drawing out the fluid from the swollen cells and relieves us of our pain through a process called \u2018osmosis\u2019. But, how does osmosis work?

Transcript: Sore throats or what we call pharyngitis are typically caused by common colds and don\u2019t usually need antibiotics Hi, I\u2019m Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson in partnership with the Washington State Department of Health; I\u2019m here to talk about sore throats, also called pharyngitis.  The main thing that you need remember is that most sore throats will get better all on their own and won\u2019t need the treatment with antibiotics.  This is because most pharyngitis, or sore throats, are caused by viruses that don\u2019t respond to antibiotics.   How can you tell the difference between a sore throat due to a virus or a bacteria?   Sore throats that are due to a virus and don\u2019t require antibiotics often cause cold-like symptoms. Things like-   \u2022 coughing and sneezing \u2022 a runny nose and watery eyes \u2022 a hoarse voice \u2022 and sometimes a fever  Sore throats caused by bacteria also called strep throat usually come on suddenly and cause a really bad sore throat along with -  \u2022 tonsils that are red and swollen, and sometimes with patches of pus   \u2022 small red spots on the roof of the mouth \u2022 fever, higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit. \u2022 tender, swollen lymph nodes under the jaw and on the front of the neck \u2022 and sometimes vomiting and a rash.  How do you treat a sore throat?  Most sore throats can be treated at home, by taking it easy for a few days, gargling with salt water, drinking warm liquids, and taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for fever and pain.  If you\u2019re concerned you or your child have strep throat, check with your healthcare provider to find out whether you should come in to be tested for strep throat. Antibiotics should not be prescribed without a positive strep test.   Thanks for listening to this information about sore throats and pharyngitis.

Hello and welcome to my channel , today I' going to share with you , two easy recipes and effective tips that'll help you gain weight in the right places.  During my skinny days, I went through stages where I didn't like to eat and later started eating a lot, but didn't add much weight, because I was eating bad calories and also had a fast metabolism-- meaning that my body processed the food really fast.  So here's how skinny people can gain weight in a healthy way. These recipes are loaded with calories, as that is what you need to add weight.  If you are a small eater, you'll add weight faster by drinking your calories, so the second recipe will be perfect for you.  In order to gain weight, you'll need to eat more calories than you burn.   Yes I know you probably have heard that a lot, but it is true. However, the trick to a faster weight gain is to make sure you are consistent with your high calorie intake.  And to  gain weight in the right places you'll have to do strenght training exercises, so that you end up gaining more muscle than body fat.    Extra tips: - Eat more calories than you burn.  - Eat about 3,000 calories per day to gain 1 tO 3 kilos of weight per week.  - Don't drink water before meals because it will fill you up and you won't eat as much as you should.  - If you're a small eater , eat more than your regular portion and add a little more to eat without forcing your self.  - Be consistent with your calorie intake and if possible track what you eat to see faster results. High Calorie foods to eat per 100gr - chicken/turkey  - salmon/tuna  - beans - high fat greek yogurt - bananas-  - avocados - protein powders/whey - peanut butter - almond butter - oats - full fat whole milk - honey - butter - coconut oil - olive oil - cashew nuts - peanut - almond nuts - dried fruits like raisins/sultanas - mangoes - papayas - pineapples - eggs (boiled, omelette or in recipes) - potatoes - wheat bread/bagel/ milk bread - pasta - cheease - red meat - salad dressings - dry seeds - pizza(oh yes baby!) - brown rice - shrimp CHOOSE YOUR FAVORITES, MIX AND MATCH AND EAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE  Easy Meal option 1:  - 1 cup oats (307 calories) - 1 Cup(250ml) full cream  milk(151 calories) - 1 very ripe banana (110 calories) - 2 tablespoons Cococnut oil(234calories) - 1/4 cup raisins(129calories) + - 2 bread rolls(250 calories or more) - 2 boiled eggs(156 calories)  TIP.: Prepare this meal in advance and in bulk and store in the fridge to use for 3 days  Easy Meal option 2: - 1 very ripe banana (110 calories) - 2 tablespoons Cococnut oil(234calories) - 3 tablespoons peanut butter or avocado (307 calories) - half cup Greek Yogurt, Full Fat(233 calories) -1 Cup(250ml) full cream  milk(151 calories)                         + - 2 bread rolls(250 calories or more) - 2 boiled eggs(156 calories)  TIP.: Prepare in bulk and store remaining in a thermal water bottle and drink with each  meal of the day or store in the fridge   You might also like_   SAUSAGE BREAD ROLL RECIPE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYJQcF6DzjI&list=PLFqGQKQamy-CNsmbdRDI16h3WXGkloyPa&index=2h3WXGkloyPa&index=2   GAIN WEIGHT AT THE RIGHT PLACES WITH NO BELLY FAT | GAIN WEIGHT IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES #howtogainweightfast #gainweightforskinnygirls #healthyweightgain #gainnweight #weightgainfood  Copyright free music from filmora wondershare", "tags": ["how to gain weight fast for skinny people", "how to gain weight fast for skinny girls", "how to gain weight with fast metabolism", "how to gain weight without gym", "how to gain weight in one week", "gain weight healthy", "how to gain weight without protein powder", "how to gain weight fast at the right places", "how to gain weight fast", "put on weight", "how to add body weight", "why can't i gain weight female", "how to gain weight without apetamin", "gain 10kg weight 1 month", "gain weight fast in a week"], "comments": 0, "likes": "24258", "channel": {"name": "Lilian Nke ", "chanenelID": "UCEP8e3lDV-brQvm7x-UkUAA", "subscribers": "136000"}, "accreditationTag": 0, "duration": 242.0, "keyword": "weight gain", "rank": 7, "consine similarity": 0.08654846448158308}
